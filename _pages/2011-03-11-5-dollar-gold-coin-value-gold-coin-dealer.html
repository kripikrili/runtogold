<p><strong>5 DOLLAR GOLD COIN VALUE</strong></p>
<p>The 5 dollar gold coin, an American gold eagle, has a gold coin value of $5 in terms of legal tender but a <em>fluctuating</em> market value which can be realized by dealing with a reputable gold coin dealer like <a title="5 dollar gold coin value" href="http://www.runtogold.com/5dollargoldcoinvalue" target="_blank">GoldSilver</a>.  This is a prime example of how a gold coins value can be different in the market as opposed to its legal tender status. One problem is because the question <a title="what is a dollar" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/05/define-the-dollar-or-else/" target="_blank">What Is A Dollar?</a> has no intelligible answer.</p>
<p><strong>AMERICAN GOLD EAGLE COIN</strong></p>
<p>The Mint of the United States began production of the American eagle 22 karat gold bullion coin in 1986. The metallic composition is 91.67% gold, 3% silver and 5.33% copper and there are several denominations such as a <a title="10 dollar gold coin value" href="http://www.runtogold.com/how-to-buy-gold-or-silver/10-dollar-gold-coin-value-gold-coin-dealer/" target="_blank">10 dollar gold coin</a>, <a title="25 dollar gold coin value" href="http://www.runtogold.com/how-to-buy-gold-or-silver/25-dollar-gold-coin-value-gold-coin-dealer/" target="_blank">25 dollar gold coin</a> and <a title="50 dollar gold coin value" href="http://www.runtogold.com/how-to-buy-gold-or-silver/50-dollar-gold-coin-value-gold-coin-dealer/" target="_blank">50 dollar gold coin</a>:</p>

<p><strong>HEAD SIDE</strong> Lady Liberty is shown on the heads side and based on a $20 gold coin, the "Double Eagle", that was designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens and produced between 1907 and 1933. WIth a torch in her right hand representing enlightenment and the symbol of peace in the left hand, an olive branch, Lady Liberty is a potent symbol.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="5 dollar gold coins value tail" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/5-dollar-gold-coins-value-tail.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p><strong>TAIL SIDE</strong> A hovering male eagle and sitting female eagle with two baby eagles is on the tails side. The male eagle also has an olive branch symbolizing peace. Inscribed is the national motto of the United States of America: IN GOD WE TRUST. Also engraved is the Great Seal of the United States along with the motto "E PLURIBUS UNUM" which is Latin for "Out of Many, One".</p>
<p>Under <a title="united states code" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/5112.html" target="_blank">31 USC 5,112</a> the gold used to mint these coins must be mined in the United States. Oddly, only 46 stars appear which is the same as on the Double Eagle gold coins which represents the number of states in 1907. A new coin has been authorized by former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and it will have 50 stars.</p>
<p><strong>5 DOLLAR GOLD COIN VALUE SPECIFICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>To recap this gold coins value, the 5 dollar American gold eagle has a gross weight of 0.1091 troy ounces or 3.393 grams. You hardly notice it in your hand. The weight of gold within the coin is 0.10 troy ounces or about 3.110 grams. The coin has a 16.5 millimeter diameter and a 1.19 millimeter thickness. Despite the tremendous value in this tiny gold coin you hardly notice it in your hand. So keep these in mind when considering the gold coin values.</p>
<p>The American Eagle five dollar gold coin value is mainly determined by the spot price of gold and the premium which makes the gold five dollar coin value slightly higher than the quoted gold price. The value of five dollar gold coin can also increase because of its usefulness in smaller transactions. Thus, the apparent increase in the five dollar gold coins value is retained over time.</p>
<p><strong>GOLD COIN DEALER</strong></p>
<p>If you want to purchase a five dollar gold coin then I recommend using a reputable gold coin dealer which has low premiums. After considerable research I recommend <a title="5 dollar gold coin value" href="http://www.runtogold.com/5dollargoldcoinvalue" target="_blank">GoldSilver</a> because they have an A rating from the BBB, low premiums and great customer service.</p>
