<h1>THE SPOT PALLADIUM PRICE</h1>
<p>The <strong>palladium price</strong> can vary widely in the spot palladium market. The palladium price is shown below in troy ounces. 1 troy ounce = 31.1034768 grams. The 200DMA is the 200 day moving average. The Relative number is the current price divided by the 200DMA. This shows whether the metals are cheap, average value, expensive or really expensive. The goal is to buy low and sell high.</p>
<h2>PALLADIUM PRICES DATA</h2>

<p>The <strong>palladium price</strong> is sometimes referred to as world palladium price, New York palladium price, London Metal Exchange palladium price, spot palladium price, market palladium price and palladium bullion price. These palladium prices are indications of the current trading palladium prices for one troy ounce of palladium on world palladium exchanges.</p>
<p>The palladium price used in the palladium price charts on Run To Gold are the 24 hour Spot Palladium Bid Price which are discovered in New York, London, Hong Kong and Sydney. These palladium prices are quoted in Federal Reserve Note dollars (FRN$). Throughout the world the palladium prices are often displayed in currencies other than the FRN$ and are converted into the local currency.</p>
<p>Like all palladium prices, the current palladium price reflects the inherent value of palladium and the relative strength of the underlying fiat currency. For example, the FRN$ price of palladium may increase more in percentage terms than palladium priced in Euros. The reason would be that the change in palladium prices is a reflection of FRN$ weakness against the Euro and would not be the result of the change in the intrinsic value of palladium based on the palladium market fundamentals.</p>
<p>Run To Gold palladium price charts are updated every 1 minute for both the live palladium price charts and the moving averages. The 50 day and 200 day moving average palladium prices are the sum of the average palladium prices for the most recent 50 or 200 trading days.</p>
