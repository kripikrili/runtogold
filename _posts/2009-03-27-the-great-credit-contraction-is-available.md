<p>I started <a href="http://www.runtogold.com" target="_blank">RunToGold</a> because friends and family suggested I start a website and I got tired of explaining the issues to them.  Daily thousands of people consume information from the site or <a href="http://podcast.runtogold.com" target="_blank">podcast</a>.  There are costs associated with running the website.  Additionally, I would like to take the site to the next level, making it easier to read, search, and use but that will require some serious professional expertise.</p>
<p><strong>NEW MEDIA MONETIZATION</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways for blogs and other new media platforms to be monetized.</p>
<p>One way is to introduce intrusive, annoying and distracting advertisements.  I loathe websites monetized this way.</p>
<p>Another way is to pay a subscription fee like the Wall Street Journal's $1.99/week.</p>
<p>Still another way is to purchase products.  These can range from physical t-shirts to digital ebooks, mp3s or videos.  <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/01/imn-real-estate-conference-and-cambridge-house/#comments" target="_blank">A few months ago I asked</a> if there was any demand for a 45-50 page foundational document for much of the theory which undergirds my writings.  I received several responses from loyal readers including:</p>
<p align="left">"I was able to make it out to the Cambridge House Conference on Sunday and will say that your individual presentation was by far the highlight of the day ... I know I would love to be notified should you ever get around to doing something of the sort.  I agree with you on the fact that finding out about the details on topics such as debt-based currency, money creation etc. is quite the process as it involves a great deal of site-surfing and picking up snippets of information here and there." - Derrick</p>
<p align="left">"Great presentation at the Cambridge House Gold Show.  You were one of the best speakers.  Could you make that Summary Report available?" - Carl</p>
<p align="left">"Would love to read a foundational document if you have the time/energy/desire to create one.  Great work on this blog.  Thank you!" - Adam</p>

<p>"I really enjoyed your presentation at the Cambridge House Investment Conference.  Thank you for staying around as long as you did for the Q&amp;A period.  It really helped me to cement the ideas.  I thought your presentation was definitely the highlight of the conference.  The foundational document you speak of would be extremely useful and would be much appreciated.  Thank you." - James</p>
