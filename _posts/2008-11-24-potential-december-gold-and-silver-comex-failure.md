title: Potential December Gold and Silver COMEX Failure
published: true
---
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qIUA1veyHk" target="_blank">John Embry</a> was recently on Canadian national television discussing the potential of a failure of delivery for the COMEX contract in December.  The COMEX market has been instrumental in perpetuating the <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2005/09/goldrush-21/">gold price suppression scheme</a>.  Should a failure to delivery happen in December it would be a 'seminal event' in the gold market.  The $80 per ounce move in the last two trading days may be a portent of what is to come.  The <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/10/the-gold-price/">gold price determinant </a>would shift to some other location, probably in Asia, with greater integrity.</p>
<p>If December Gold or December Silver will fail to deliver it should happen between Nov 28 and Dec 29.  Here are some dates to keep in mind:</p>
<p><span>Nov. 20   Comex December gold options expire<br />
Nov. 20   Comex December silver options expire</span></p>
<p><span>Nov. 24   Comex December miNY gold futures last trading day<br />
Nov. 24   Comex December miNY silver futures last trading day</span></p>
<p><span>Nov. 28   Comex December gold futures first notice day  <span><span style="font-style: normal;">**1st day to take delivery**</span></span><br />
Nov. 28   Comex December silver futures first notice day <span><span style="font-style: normal;">**1st day to take delivery**</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Dec. 29   Comex December gold futures last trading day  <span><span style="font-style: normal;">**Last day to take delivery**</span></span><br />
Dec. 29   Comex December silver futures last trading day <span><span style="font-style: normal;">**Last day to take delivery**</span></span><br />

<p>Failure to deliver is not unheard of in the commodities markets.  In 2006 the <a href="http://www.lme.com/4670.asp" target="_blank">London Metal Exchange</a> imposed a $300 per ton penalty when nickel went into backwardation.  The LME CEO said, "Nickel stocks are at historically low levels and we now have a <strong>genuine material shortage</strong>. Our first priority is to ensure that trading remains orderly and to prevent the <strong>risk of settlement defaults</strong>."</p>
<p>The great thing about commodities is that they are either in your possession or not.  What good is a penalty assessed to a bankrupt <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/06/counter-party-risk/">counter-party</a>?  When major financial institutions like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, etc. can be vaporized overnight why be content with accepting their counter-party risk through a penalty assessed for backwardation?  If you purchase bullion then demand delivery to yourself or a trusted third-party vaulting service like <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/goldmoney/">GoldMoney</a>.  As mentioned in September on the <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/09/daily-source-code-788/">Daily Source Code</a> and also observed by <a href="http://www.boom2bust.com/2008/10/14/the-disconnect-between-physical-gold-demand-and-the-paper-gold-price/" target="_blank">Boom2Bust</a> the retail coin and bar market is getting extremely tight.  Those who fail to take possession of the bullion and instead hold paper claims such as COMEX contracts, ETFs like GLD, SLV, etc. and a myriad of other forms of '<a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/09/daily-source-code-792/">paper gold</a>' will receive just that 'paper'.  That paper can become worthless.</p>
<p>The financial markets, particularly the gold and silver markets, could be in for some very interesting events in the not to distant future.  Be prepared.</p>
