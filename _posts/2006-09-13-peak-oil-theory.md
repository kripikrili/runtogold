<p><span>An <a href="http://runtogold.com/sounds/MattSavinar.mp3">interview</a> with Matt Savinar in 2005 about the Peak Oil Theory.  He has been heavily quoted before the US Congress.  The use of a commodity based monetary system allows for allocations of capital in accordance with Energy Return On Energy Invested and would probably prevent the undesirable effects that result from populations overshooting their resource base.  <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/10/world-made-by-hand/">World Made By Hand</a> is an entertaining novel on the topic.</span></p>

<p><span>Last year a report prepared for the US Department of Energy spelled it out in terms that could be plucked from Armageddon. "The world has never faced a problem like this. Without massive mitigation more than a decade before the fact, the problem will be pervasive and will not be temporary. Previous energy transitions were gradual and evolutionary. Oil peaking will be abrupt and revolutionary."</span></p>
