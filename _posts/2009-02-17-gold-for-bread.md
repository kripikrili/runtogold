<p>Zimbabwe is a very resource rich country.  Their current financial problems have resulted in widespread anger towards the tyrant Mugabe.  Inflation leads to shortages, shortages lead to rationing and rationing leads to starvation.  I highly recommend viewing this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2009/feb/11/zimbabwe-gold-panning-starvation-food" target="_blank">short video by the Guardian</a> about gold being exchanged for bread in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>While the future is not etched in gold the video serves as a stark current example of what can happen as a result of legal tender laws and not properly dealing with politicians.</p>
