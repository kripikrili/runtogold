title: Federal Reserve Will Fail With Quantitative Easing
published: true

<p>Quantitative easing; everybody is doing it like the <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/01/bank-of-england-and-quantitative-easing/" target="_blank">Bank of England</a>, Japan and even Switzerland.  <strong><span><a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/11/quantitative-easing-and-gold/" target="_blank">Quantitative easing</a></span></strong> is a tool of monetary policy.  The effect is an increase in the <strong>quantity</strong> of currency without regard to maintaining its <strong>quality</strong>.  Quantitative is relating to, measuring, or measured by the <strong>quantity</strong> of something rather than its <strong>quality</strong>.  On 18 March 2009 <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aeP8.XnGrN64&amp;refer=home" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> reported that the Federal Reserve announced the intent to purchase $300B of longer-term Treasuries.  Predictably, the Federal Reserve has decided to exacerbate the quantitative easing party.   This has an effective on quantitative finance.</p>
<p>What is really going on is the great <a href="http://www.creditcontraction.com" target="_blank">credit contraction</a>.  <strong>The system does not collapse but evaporate.</strong> As the evaporation has continued and intensified capital, both real and fictitious, has sought safer and more liquid assets by moving down the liquidity pyramid.  A significant, but still miniscule amount, of capital has already evaporated over the past year.  This is <strong>basic economic law</strong> being asserted.  A predictable consequence has been for Treasury rates to near 0% because they are considered among the safest and most liquid assets.</p>

<p>But the <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/01/united-states-treasuries-are-the-biggest-bubble-of-all/" target="_blank">United States Treasury bubble is the biggest of all</a> and there are reasons <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/01/why-and-how-the-treasury-bubble-will-burst/" target="_blank">how and why the Treasury bubble will burst</a>.</p>
<p><strong>At all times and in all circumstances gold remains money.</strong> Gold is the ultimate form of payment and is always accepted.  Gold is the safest and most liquid asset.  As I surgically explained, the <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/12/a-problem-with-gld-and-slv-etfs/" target="_blank">ETFs GLD and SLV</a> are <strong>NOT</strong> gold or silver.  The question then becomes:  <strong>Will capital move up or down the liquidity pyramid?</strong></p>

<p>How did gold perform in reaction to Bernanke's announcement?  A monstrous and almost immediate rise of about $60 per ounce.  The gold cartel <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2005/09/goldrush-21/" target="_blank">GATA</a> has shined a light on must of had its hands full today.  This is all the more ominous because gold is not just a commodity or portfolio asset but a currency which, through tools like <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/goldmoney" target="_blank">GoldMoney</a>, can be used in ordinary daily transactions.  Because silver is also money; the chronic <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/02/five-weeks-of-silver-backwardation/" target="_blank">silver backwardation</a> is equally if not more ominous.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Silver in Backwardation" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Silver-backwardation.jpg" alt="" width="596" height="429" /></p>
<p>I have long asserted that the FRN$ will be the <strong>last</strong> major fiat currency to evaporate in the <a href="http://www.creditcontraction.com" target="_blank">great credit contraction</a> and that <strong>g</strong><strong>old will still be there </strong>when the next credit expansion begins.  This misguided action by Mr. Bernanke will only hasten the rate of evaporation.  The <a href="http://www.creditcontraction.com" target="_blank">great credit contraction</a> has just begun and in the aggregate capital will continue moving down, not up, the liquidity pyramid.</p>
