<h1>SPOT PRECIOUS METAL PRICES</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Metal prices</strong> can vary widely in the spot market. The <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/metal-prices/gold-price-and-gold-prices/">gold price</a>, <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/metal-prices/silver-price-and-silver-prices/">silver price</a>,Â <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/metal-prices/platinum-price-and-platinum-prices/">platinum price</a> or <a title="palladium price" href="http://www.runtogold.com/metal-prices/palladium-price-and-palladium-prices/">palladium price</a> are shown below. 1 troy ounce = 31.1034768 grams. The 200DMA is the 200 day moving average. The Relative number is the current price divided by the 200DMA. As I discussed in <a title="200 day moving average" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2010/07/200-day-moving-average/" target="_blank">200 Day Moving Average - The Pull Of Gravity</a>, this shows whether the metals are cheap, average value, expensive or really expensive. The goal is to buy low and sell high.<br />

<h2>METAL PRICES DATA</h2>
<p>RunToGold.com metal prices are provided by a data feed from <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/goldmoney">GoldMoney</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Metal prices</strong> are sometimes referred to as world metal prices, New York metal prices, London Metal Exchange metal prices, spot metal prices, market metal prices and bullion prices. These metal prices are indications of the current trading prices for one troy ounce of silver, one troy ounce of gold or one troy ounce of platinum on world exchanges.</p>
<p>The metal prices used in the gold price charts, silver price charts and platinum price charts on Run To Gold are the 24 hour Spot Gold Bid Price, 24 hour Spot Silver Bid Price and 24 hour Spot Platinum Bid Price which are discovered in New York, London, Hong Kong and Sydney. These metal prices are quoted in Federal Reserve Note dollars (FRN$). Throughout the world the metal prices are often displayed in currencies other than the FRN$ and are converted into the local currency.</p>
<p>Like all metal prices, the gold prices, silver prices, platinum prices and palladium prices reflects the inherent value of gold, silver, platinum and palladium and the relative strength of the fiat currency. For example, the FRN$ metal price of gold may increase more in percentage terms than the gold price in Euros. The reason would be that the change in metal prices is a reflection of FRN$ weakness against the Euro and would not be the result of the change in the intrinsic value of gold based on the gold market fundamentals.</p>
<p>Run To Gold metal prices charts are updated every 1 minute for both the live gold price charts, live silver price charts, live platinum price charts and live palladium price charts. The 50 day and 200 day moving average prices are the sum of the average metal prices for the most recent 50 or 200 trading days.</p>
