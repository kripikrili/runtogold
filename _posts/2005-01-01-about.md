<p>The main purpose of my work, almost all of it provided to all mankind for free and at great risk to myself since tyrants love to silence the conscience, is to provide ideas and information on monetary science and economics that will combat the extremely dangerous false ideas currently in the marketplace causing many undesirable and harmful effects.</p>
<p>Ideas can only be overcome by other ideas. Money and force are impotent against ideas.  Government abuse of currency has enabled many evils including the <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/11/gold-standard-advocate/">rise of dictators</a> and perpetuation of genocide.  The abandonment of sound money is the chief reason, if not the only reason, that the world has become such a dangerous place.</p>
<p>These issues are not new. Polymath Goethe warned about the deleterious effects stemming from abuse of currency in <a href="http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/German/FaustIIActIScenesItoVII.htm">Faust Part Two starting on line 4,925</a> and 1844 United States Presidential candidate Joseph Smith said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I consider that it is not only prudential, but <strong>absolutely necessary</strong> to protect the inhabitants of this city from being imposed upon by a spurious currency…I think it <strong>much safer</strong> to go upon the <strong>hard money system</strong> altogether. I have examined the Constitution upon this subject and find my doubts removed…Article I, Section 10 declares that nothing else except gold and silver shall be lawful tender…The different states, and even Congress itself, have passed many laws diametrically contrary to the Constitution of the United States…The Constitution acknowledges that the people have all power not reserved to itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the worldwide fiat monetary system evaporates it will take education and humility to successfully navigate the chasm and retain one’s wealth.  We are feeling the gigantic tectonic plates underneath the financial system begin to shift.</p>
<p>The shift of wealth that is happening is gargantuan and if one is properly positioned they can profit handsomely from the change.  Luck is when preparation meets opportunity. You can subscribe to get free email updates.</p>
