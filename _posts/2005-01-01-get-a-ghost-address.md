<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>EARTH CLASS MAIL</strong>.  WOW. Earth Class Mail is indispensable tool to maintain my location independence as I travel the world. Rarely do I come across a good or service with as much utility and value for the cost.  <a href="http://www.myearthclassmail.com" target="_blank">Earth Class Mail</a>, the <strong>best mail forwarding service</strong> I have found, has been a solid tool of mine for a few years and is a powerful ghost address.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.myearthclassmail.com" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" title="Earth Class Mail - best mail forwarding service" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ECM-GLOBE.gif" alt="" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p><strong>PRIVACY.</strong> Perhaps the best benefit is increased privacy along with the time savings and convenience since packages, even those requiring signatures, are always delivered.  Next is being able to receive packages at a street address in Oregon which assesses no sales tax.</p>
<p>For example, if you order a laptop you will pay about $300 in sales tax. Shipped to Oregon you pay nothing to the merchant! Of course, see the section on sales and use tax near the conclusion. Then combine all your mail and forward it via USPS, UPS or Fedex to anywhere in the world and know exactly when it is delivered since you can track it. <strong>Protip:</strong> For increased privacy ship via Fedex to a Fedex store and then visit it to pick-up the shipment.</p>

<p>This can help you become location independent.</p>
<p><strong>CONSTANT 'GHOST' ADDRESS.</strong> A constant physical address and superb mail anonymity service increases your privacy and helps protect your financial affairs from things like identity theft. Not only will this protect your privacy and save money but also your FICO score may increase as your location independence is achieved.  Swiss Post, a license partner, has launched Swiss Post Box in Europe, with addresses in 5 countries, providing their users with secure postal boxes with on-line access.</p>
<h2><strong>MAIL FORWARDING SERVICE</strong></h2>
<p><strong>QUICK SHIPMENTS.</strong> With this mail forwarding service you are able to determine what goes into each shipment and then mail it anywhere or to anyone via USPS, Fedex or UPS. <strong>Protip:</strong> For increased privacy ship via Fedex to a Fedex store and then visit it to pick-up the shipment.</p>
<p><strong>REDUCE EXPENSES.</strong> Receiving shipments can often be expensive to receive if only counting the time inconvenience. If you miss the delivery then it takes time and money to go pick up the package. Sales tax may also be a substantive and material cost.  With a physical address in Beaverton, Oregon 97005 where packages may be signed for, delivered and forwarded via FedEx you can eliminate all of these hassles. Additionally, Oregon does not assess sales or use tax.</p>
<p><strong>BE GREEN.</strong> The use of <a href="http://www.myearthclassmail.com" target="_blank">Earth Class Mail</a> reduces the amount of transportation expenses used in delivering your mail.  Mail can also be easily and efficiently shredded or recycled.  Be green for the environment and save money!</p>
<p><strong>INSURANCE.</strong> ID Theft is a major concern.  An ounce of prevention can be worth a pound of cure. With <a href="http://www.myearthclassmail.com" target="_blank">Earth Class Mail</a> as your mail forwarding service you do not need to worry about the security of your mailbox because of the extremely intense security precautions taken. If you are gone for a significant period of time you do not need to get a hold on your mail or worry about it piling up in your box or at the post office. Plus, you are ensured continuity in the event of a disaster. This makes <a href="http://www.myearthclassmail.com" target="_blank">Earth Class Mail</a> a great form of insurance to provide for stable handling of your postal mail.</p>
<p><strong>CONVENIENT.</strong> When I first got <a href="http://www.myearthclassmail.com" target="_blank">Earth Class Mail</a> I had fun with the novelty of receiving and reading my postal mail while being thousands of miles away.  Being location independent was handy but not really essential.</p>
<p>But I did not notice the true value until I was on a trip to South America for a two months. I enjoyed my trip more because I never had a thought of concern about the security of the new debit card, credit card, tax paperwork and packages. Even if you do not save on the sales tax aspects with purchases or by avoiding ID Theft there is still this increased benefit of convenience and peace of mind.</p>
<p><strong>JUNK MAIL.</strong> <a href="http://www.myearthclassmail.com" target="_blank">Earth Class Mail</a> helps you reduce and eliminate junk mail. With a few clicks of the mouse you can easily send any of it to be recycled. This saves time and we all know time is money!</p>
<p><strong>EASY TO USE INTERFACE.</strong> The interface when you login is easy to use and helps save you time by organizing your postal mail like you would organize email.</p>

<p><strong>MINOR DOWNSIDES.</strong> There are some minor downsides.  The cost of about $20 per month. Plus, scans can be pretty expensive. Currently addresses are only available in the United States unless you use Swiss Post. There is a check deposit service but it seems fairly expensive but the fee may be acceptable to establish your location independence. Finally, currently the registered agent service is limited to states where I would not want to be incorporated.</p>
<p><strong>SALES AND USE TAX.</strong> States may have a ‘sales &amp; use tax’ you are required to remit even if you make a purchase out of state.  Of course, learn and follow all applicable law.</p>
