excerpt: Sound money and the environment.  Governments cause the most pollution.

<p><img class="alignright" title="Vaclav Klaus" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Vaclav.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="177" />The European Union has recently undergone significant changes.  French President Nicolas Sarkozy chaired his last European Council.  On January 1st the Czech Republic claimed the seat with Václav Klaus, the Czech President, becomming the new European Council chairmen.</p>
<p>At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland Mr. Klaus remarked, "I don't think there is any global warming, environmentalism and global-warming alarmism are challenging our freedom."  Mr. Klaus asserted that Mr. Gore, the jet-setting global warming champion, refuses to listen to competing theories and was probably referring to a U.S. Senate report including opinions from over 650 scientists who debunked claims of scientific consensus on global warming.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2389" title="global_warming" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/global_warming.jpg" alt="global_warming" width="300" height="236" />Mr. Klaus's remarks sparked extreme public outrage in pristine Canada and bastion of the green movement.  This photograph from the ground reveals the extreme displeasure over these controversial remarks.  It appears the Canadians may have too much time on their hands.</p>
<p>James M. Taylor, senior fellow at the 25-year old non-profit <a href="http://www.heartland.org/" target="_blank">The Heartland Institute</a> said, "President Klaus is a human rights warrior and a true champion of basic human freedoms. His insight into the negative correlation between heavy-handed greenhouse gas restrictions and basic human freedoms will provide a sensational addition to the 2009 International Conference on Climate Change."</p>
<p>Joseph Bast, president of <a href="http://www.heartland.org/" target="_blank">The Heartland Institute</a> said, "In the past nine months, the science has grown even more convincing that global warming is not a crisis. The crisis has been cancelled by sound science and common sense."</p>
<p><strong>THE REAL POLLUTERS</strong></p>
<p>The doctrine of sovereign immunity is that the sovereign or state cannot commit a legal wrong and is immune from civil suit or criminal prosecution.  The United States operates hundreds of military bases employing millions of people throughout the world with one purpose:  to destroy things.  December 8th in <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20081209-9999-7n9jetdown.html" target="_blank">San Diego a jet fighter</a> crashed obliterating a residential home and slaughtering the family inside.  After invading Nye county, Nevada against their will and inflicting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Test_Site" target="_blank">nuclear weapon tests</a> does the federal government pay damages?  Of course not.  Does it assert the sovereign immunity doctrine?  Of course.</p>
<p>The violation of property rights is a serious issue.  Taking care of the environment is a serious issue.  Providing for causes of action against and prosecution of polluters is important.  But the largest polluter of all are governments.  Why give governments more power?  When you subsidize something you get more of it.  Polluting governments are heavily subsidized and therefore the world gets more pollution.</p>
<p><strong>THE REAL SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>Gold and silver are not mere commodities but essential checks and balances in America's political machinery.  The monetary powers and disabilities, found in Article 1 Section 8 Clause 5 and Article 1 Section 10 Clause 1, protect against despotic inroads by government.  They prevent confiscation through inflation which is a form of taxation without representation or due process of law.</p>
<p>If a sound money system were practiced then the fruits of the labor of individuals could not be confiscated through inflation to fund nuclear weapon tests on pristine land along with thousands of other examples.  Tortious actors would more likely be held to account for their infringements of property rights and therefore be financially deterred from polluting.  This would likely result in a decrease in pollution.</p>
<p>Mr. Gore's assertion that more government is the solution is completely false.  Government is not the solution; government is the problem.  More government involvement will only result in more assertions of sovereign immunity and when privileged entities cause severe environmental damage they will be 'bailed out'.  <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0505-09.htm" target="_blank">Union Carbide's Bhopal disaster</a> is a stark example [Note:  Union Carbide was purchased in 2002 by Dow Chemical.].  <strong>Under the current fiat currency monetary system, in opposition to the US Constitution, the government and other factions financially benefit from causing pollution.</strong></p>
<p>The current state of environmental damage has been primarily caused because of government's interference in the currency market through legal tender laws.  If the markets were free of government interference and if property rights were protected then the world be a much cleaner and greener place.  As the great <a href="http://www.creditcontraction.com" target="_blank">credit contraction</a> relentlessly grinds the result may be a cleaner and greener world.</p>
