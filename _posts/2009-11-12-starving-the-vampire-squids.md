<p><strong>[pullquote]Bitcoin is the single most powerful tool you have to starve the vampire squid.[/pullquote]</strong><em>The world’s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money</em>. - Matt Taibbi, “<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/28816321/inside_the_great_american_bubble_machine">Inside the Great American Bubble Machine</a>”</p>
<p>The vampire squids of Wall Street and Washington DC are parasitic organisms and you are locked in mortal combat with them.  They desire to suck all the value they can from you and then toss your carcass aside.  As with most parasites they prefer subtle tactics that do not attract attention.</p>
<p>But now the spotlight is being directed towards them and individual humans are becoming increasingly aware of their status as <a id="aptureLink_ZGKfHtvFpP" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P772Eb63qIY">human livestock</a> to be feasted upon and slaughtered by these parasitic vampire squids.  Increasing numbers are declaring their independence from these nefarious parasites.  There are a few simple things you can do to defend yourselves from these repulsive <a title="psychopathic court economists" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/04/insane-psycho-sociopathic-court-economists/" target="_blank">psychopathic</a> parasitic vampire squids and assert your sovereignty.</p>

<p><strong>IMPROVE YOUR INFORMATION DIET</strong></p>
<p>If an individual sustains life by eating low quality junk food then they are more susceptible to disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, inflammation and a host of other health problems.  A few small changes in one's physical diet can have a tremendous effect on one's health and general feeling wellbeing.</p>
<p>So likewise your time and attention is extremely valuable.  Most Americans watch 5-10 hours of television per week.  A significant problem with television and corporate media is the degree of misinformation and subliminal programming.</p>
<p>A subliminal message is a signal or message embedded in another medium, designed to pass below the normal limits of the human mind's perception. These messages are unrecognizable by the conscious mind, but in certain situations can affect the subconscious mind and can negatively or positively influence subsequent later thoughts, behaviors, actions, attitudes, belief systems and value systems.</p>
<p>Because of the consensual nature of watching television you let your intellectual guard down and are more susceptible to the lies, misinformation and subtle tactics of programming that are engaged in by the archaic media.  In most cases, their corporate profits are in a direct conflict of interest to your happiness.  A blatant example would be the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>By removing TV and corporate media from your daily information diet you can reallocate a large amount of your time to more productive uses, start a new hobby, develop additional skills or a host of other things.  By purifying your information diet and purging the toxic and harmful influences the probability for having a happier and more fulfilled life increases.  As many people have been doing this the <a title="newspapers evaporating" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/03/newspapers-evaporating-at-tremendous-speeds/" target="_blank">newspapers have been evaporating</a> at rapid speeds.</p>
<p><strong>CEASE RELATIONSHIPS WITH CORRUPT PEOPLE AND INSTITUTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Banks, brokerages, insurance companies, cable operators, credit card issuers, etc. are almost completely corrupt.  You cannot afford to have contact or business relationships with this infestation of parasitic vampire squids.  You cannot afford to allow these liars, thieves and murders to handle your money and data.</p>
<p>Whenever you do business or transact with a corporation who has access to your data then your privacy is greatly diminished or removed through the use of <a title="transactional database" href="http://www.howtovanish.com/2009/11/transactional-databases-what-me-worry/" target="_blank">transactional databases</a>.  Because of the highly invasive nature of these tools I think it is extremely important that you think seriously about who you reveal data to and who you will allow to access your data.</p>
<p>Dr. Colin Ross, a psychologist with <a title="cchr international" href="http://www.cchrint.org/" target="_blank">CCHR International</a>, a mental health watchdog, reveals findings from 15,000+ pages of documents disclosed under the Freedom Of Information Act in his book <a title="military mind control" href="http://www.runtogold.com/militarymindcontrolbook" target="_blank">Military Mind Control</a> about inhumane treatment by psychologists employed by the CIA and major pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly which <a id="aptureLink_Fus591Rm35" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IStoyUb697c">first manufactured LSD under government contract</a>.</p>
<p>Although there are some laws in place regarding privacy we see how well the <em>traitorous</em> vampire squids of Washington DC behave when executing their oath to 'preserve, protect and defend the Constitution'.  So assume there is no privacy and work actively to protect it and learn <a title="how to vanish" href="http://www.howtovanish.com" target="_blank">how to vanish</a>.</p>
<p><strong>[pullquote]If you really want to cause some serious damage to the State then start using Bitcoin as much as possible.[/pullquote]BITCOIN AND STARVING THE VAMPIRE SQUID</strong></p>
<p>The Information Age has seen radical changes in how information is distributed. <strong>First</strong>, postal services were rapidly replaced by email for <em>transferring</em> messages. <strong>Second</strong>, open-source software like Wordpress, which powers RunToGold, CNN and most blogs, led to the replacement of newspapers, magazines and books for <em>transferring</em> ideas. <strong>Third</strong>, instead of using the television or radio we have seen the rise of podcasts, sites like YouTube and tools like BitTorrent changed the way of <em>transferring</em> media content.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>, the heroic <a title="cypherpunks" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk" target="_blank">cypherpunks</a> have provided us with a tool for the <em>transferring</em> of value. No longer do we need to use barbarous relics like Federal Reserve Notes, Euros, Yen, gold, silver, stones, seashells or cigarettes. <br/><br/>There is an alternative to the state-issued fiat currencies. Sell the common stocks of governments and buy the common stock of the crypto-anarcho-capitalists. A new nation, with a foundation in math, is rising. A nation where violence is rendered inert because no amount of violence will solve a math problem. Vote with your money!</p>

<p>Often, Lew Rockwell has referred to the Federal Reserve as the heart of the State. This is because of its ability to engage in confiscation through inflation which is a form of taxation without representation. If the Federal Reserve note is the blood, the Federal Reserve is the heart then banks, credit cards and Paypal would be the veins of transferring value.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a poisoned dart aimed with perfect precision at the heart of the State. Bitcoin is both the blood and the veins thus becoming highly censorship resistant.</p>
<p>The most powerful tool you have to starve the vampire squid is Bitcoin, a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. If you really want to cause some serious damage to the State then start using Bitcoin as much as possible. Starve the banks of cash balances, their oxygen, by moving that capital into bitcoins. <br/><br/>Starve the credit card companies of their billion in transaction fees. To encourage merchants to accept bitcoins then you can boycott them just like I have boycotted Stratfor for failing to accept Bitcoin.</p>
<p>For more complicated tactics you may consider using strategies from <a title="mini guide to financial privacy" href="https://www.coindl.com/page/item/106" target="_blank">The How To Vanish Mini-Guide To Financial Privacy </a>coupled with <a title="a lawyer's take on bitcoin and taxes" href="https://www.coindl.com/page/item/104" target="_blank">A Lawyer's Take On Bitcoin And Taxes</a> complete with over 100 legal citations to cases, statutes, regulations, etc. and both only available with payment via bitcoins.</p>
<p>A sound money system must, like freedom, bubble up from the people. If you want it then come and claim it. So stop your whining, stop your moaning, stop your complaining and start doing. Hit them where it will hurt the most. Start starving the vampire squids of revenue, sales, transaction fees and capital. This is how you can inflict some serious financial harm on these nefarious bastards.</p>
<p>To drastically shorten your learning curve with Bitcoin I have put together a free guide: <a title="a beginner's guide to bitcoin and bitcoin services" href="https://www.coindl.com/page/item/242" target="_blank">A Beginner's Guide To Bitcoin and Bitcoin Services</a>.</p>

<p><strong>IMPECCABLE COMPLIANCE WITH COSTUMED CRIMINAL GANGS</strong></p>
<p>The traitorous vampire squids strut around in their costumes extorting your hard earned wealth while they regularly flaunt the law and like Tim 'tax cheat' Geithner they willingly evade the taxes levied on themselves.  Of course, there is a massive industry that derives revenue from involuntary incarceration. <br/><br/> Your freedom is in conflict with their profits.  This is a reason why America has the highest documented incarceration rate in the world with over 7.2 million adults on probation, parole or in either jail or prison.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="United States Incarceration" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/United-States-Incarceration.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="281" /></p>
<p>While Americans like to sing that they are the 'land of the free' it is really the home of the incarcerated.  To avoid being engulfed by this massive police state you should be <a id="aptureLink_jyVA79DLgJ" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqMjMPlXzdA">properly trained</a> on how to interact with the <a title="cops psychologically damaged" href="http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab005601.html" target="_blank">psychologically damaged</a> and intellectually retarded criminal gangs that masquerade in costumes as peace officers.</p>
<p>For example, in 1999 in Jordan v. City of New London <a title="robert jordan too smart cop" href="http://www.postroad.com/news/2000/20000912.new.london.pd.robert.jordan.html" target="_blank">Robert Jordan</a> of Waterford, CT, a corrections officer, received worldwide attention when his application to the New London, CT Police Department was rejected on the grounds that candidates scoring too high on intelligence tests become bored with police work and often quit. <br/><br/>Jordan scored a 33 on the Wonderlic intelligence test, a feat equivalent to having an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of 125. New London's policy is <strong>limited to interviewing candidates with scores between 20 and 27</strong>.</p>
<p>Consequently, it is extremely wise when one is unjustifiably subject to these presidents, kings, rulers or magistrates to be impeccably compliant with their extortions and threats.  <br/><br/>This compliance is recommended not because of some faux moral duty like Hitler's perverted interpretation of Romans 13 but instead because if a robber sticks a loaded gun to your head and says 'Your wallet or your life.' then it is usually a better outcome to lose only your wallet.</p>
<p>But make no mistake; the robber's demand is immoral and therefore you are under no moral duty to obey and under most state's self-defense statutes you would be justified in using lethal force against the aggressor.  America is the largest police state in the history of the world with highly complex rules and very little privacy protection.  Therefore it is wise to never violate the various gang rules.</p>
<p><strong>REPOSITION ASSETS</strong></p>
<p>We live in economic warfare and as with any game there is a goal:  <strong>equity</strong> and <strong>control</strong>.</p>
<p>Most people underinvest in their health and knowledge with poor physical and information diets.  With malnourished human intellectual capital it is very difficult to be successful.  To reposition your assets you will need your health, knowledge, intelligence and the ability to think and act.</p>
<p>We currently live in an illusory economy but because <a title="credit contraction" href="http://www.creditcontraction.com" target="_blank">The Great Credit Contraction</a> has begun we are transitioning to a real economy where individuals want hard assets.  The <a title="chinese hunting trip" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/02/the-latest-chinese-hunting-trip/" target="_blank">Chinese are on hunting trips</a> for real assets.  They are exchanging their illusory Federal Reserve Note for farmland, oil, gas, water, etc.  So it is wise to shift out of financial assets and into tangible assets or securities that have solid economics behind them.</p>
<p><strong>LONG TERM TRENDS</strong></p>
<p>The trend is your friend.  The vampire squids of Wall Street, with <a id="aptureLink_aGOAHrXTS4" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUkbdjetlY8">shills like Jim Cramer</a>, attempt to goad you into playing follow the vampire squid.  This results in a lot of people being so busy trading they are unable to fundamentally analyze what they own.  The more fractionalized your mind is from rabid trading the easier it is for the vampire squids to harvest you.</p>
<p>Precious metals are in a long-term secular bull market and fiat currencies are in a long-term secular bear market.  <a title="certificates of confiscation" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/10/confiscating-certificates-of-confiscation/" target="_blank">Certificates of confiscation</a> will evaporate your wealth. <br/><br/> High quality farmland, food and clean water are becoming increasingly scarce and important.  Jim Rogers analyzes and discusses the reasons in <a title="hot commodities" href="http://www.runtogold.com/hotcommoditiesbook" target="_blank">Hot Commodities</a>.  The old saying is, 'The trend is your friend'.</p>
<p><strong>REVOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>Sure, you can <a title="buying gold" href="http://www.how-to-buy-gold-safely.com/" target="_blank">buy gold</a> hoping to make a profit or even protect your purchasing power.  There are plenty of objective reasons for doing so.   For example, those who followed the advice on <a title="runtogold" href="http://www.runtogold.com" target="_blank">RunToGold</a> would have significantly more purchasing power given platinum has risen from $1,118 to $1,375. <br/><br/> So likewise the analysis has been provided with <a title="silver backwardation" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/09/silver-trending-towards-backwardation-again/" target="_blank">silver's slight backwardation</a> and the fundatmentals for <a title="buy platinum" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/07/platinum-liquidity-increases/" target="_blank">buying platinum</a>.</p>
<p>But there are more important reasons for buying the precious metals.  <strong>When you own the monetary metals you own sovereign wealth</strong>.  In effect, you have declared independence and are fighting all the central banks and vampire squids in the world.</p>
<p>There are two ways to fight a revolution and assert your sovereignty against immoral criminal gangs costumed in government regalia:  guns and currency.  The use of fiat currency allows for confiscation through inflation which is a form of taxation without representation and without due process of law.</p>
<p>Are you upset about Congress passing the health car bill?  Does the cash for clunkers program of destroying working vehicles annoy you?<br/><br/>  What about privatizing the gains and socializing the losses to the tune of trillions of dollars that is used to bailout the vampire squids of Wall Street?  Does the closed-source software and the <a id="aptureLink_Zowv68Ns9s" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D346bkr15VU#t=246">murky voting process</a> cause you to doubt the veracity of the political system?</p>
<p>One method of peaceful protest is <a title="buying gold" href="http://www.runtogold.com/how-to-buy-gold-or-silver/" target="_blank">buying gold</a> or some other commodity currency such as <a title="buy silver" href="http://www.how-to-buy-silver-safely.com/" target="_blank">silver</a> or <a title="buy platinum" href="http://www.how-to-buy-platinum-safely.com/" target="_blank">platinum</a>.  Doing so is a vote of no confidence in the current system.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="vote from rooftops" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Vote-From-Rooftops.jpg" alt="" width="403" height="304" /></p>
<p>As a peacemaker I hate to observe the other method which involves violence and will only result in undesirable consequences and darker days.  There is a big difference between starving parasitic vampire squids and terminating them.<br/><br/>  <strong>We all know the golden rule : He who has the gold makes the rules.</strong> One of the reasons the vampire squids are able to harvest the American people so efficiently is because the American people have no gold.</p>
<p>As Mark Dice found out they would <a id="aptureLink_FgJCAITGLJ" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk5aRIz17fk">not even buy a 1 ounce gold coin for $50</a>!  Perhaps that is the most bullish aspect of this secular bull market in the precious metals.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Parasitic vampire squids are swarming around trying to harvest both the wealth you produce and you.  To protect yourself take control of your information diet, cease relationships with corrupt people and institutions, maintain impeccable compliance with the arbitrary rules and regulations of the costumed criminal gangs, understand the long-term trends, reposition your assets, implement <a title="provident living" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/08/provident-living-principles/" target="_blank">provident living principles</a> in your ordinary daily activities, and establish your independence from these parasitic vampire squids. <a title="begin using bitcoin" href="https://www.coindl.com/page/item/242" target="_blank">Begin using Bitcoin</a> as much as possible. Declare your independence!</p>
