<p>My article <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/12/a-problem-with-gld-and-slv-etfs/" target="_blank">A Problem with GLD and SLV ETFs</a> was published on <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/author/trace-mayer" target="_blank">Seeking Alpha</a>.  It was picked up by <a href="http://www.gata.org/node/6992" target="_blank">GATA</a>, the big daddy elephant <a href="http://jsmineset.com/index.php/2008/12/14/in-the-news-today-61/" target="_blank">Jim Sinclair</a> along with many other luminaries in the gold industry.  Fortunately, the website host had no problems with the increased traffic.  Additionally, there are quite a few new subscribers to the free email updates.  I suppose it would be courteous to welcome them.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Alligator Feeding Frenzy" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/alligator-feeding-frenzy.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" />Readers are somewhat like alligators that prowl around looking to be fed.  Both <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/12/gold-in-backwardation/" target="_blank">Gold in Backwardation</a> and <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/12/a-problem-with-gld-and-slv-etfs/" target="_blank">A Problem with GLD and SLV ETFs</a> along with many other articles <strong>have been answers to user submitted questions</strong>.  There are forms throughout the site including in the <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/about/" target="_blank">About</a> section.  Please let me know what type of food you want.  Bankers do not count.  I have performed significant amounts of original research and work and many of the topics have been suggested by loyal readers.  Some tasty articles include <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/02/first-snowfall-of-kondratieff-winter/" target="_blank">The First Snowfall of the Kondratieff Winter</a> and <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/10/gold-privacy-and-constitutional-rights/" target="_blank">Gold Privacy and Constitutional Rights</a>.  I am currently working on some extremely interesting articles which are about to be tossed into the middle of the frenzy.</p>
<p>On that note, I have had many inquiries about the Canadian CEF.  I have not done much research on this vehicle and do not currently have an opinion.  I will put it in the queue.  However, after reading through the GLD (43 pages!) and SLV prospectuses I can understand why you may want to shy away from doing it yourself.  Having read or drafted thousands of pages of legal documents I must say that the only thing worse than reading these complex legal documents is drafting them!</p>
<p>While I cannot guarantee I will answer your questions, let alone a time frame, I do welcome them and should I see a pattern among them I will research the topic to develop and articulate an informed opinion.  Hopefully this will result in an actionable article for you.</p>
<p>On another note, the new <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/watch_out_wifi_here_comes_mifi.php" target="_blank">MiFi</a> looks like an extremely useful device for anyone who travels a lot.  Here is a pictorial update on the <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2008/12/2008_greek_riots.html" target="_blank">civil unrest in Greece</a> I wrote about Dec. 11, 2008.  I thought LA would be the first city to break out in major riots as a result of the economic turmoil.  Who would have thought it would be Athens?  An estimated $1.5B in damage has been caused so far.</p>
