<p><img class="alignright" title="Armenian Dram Devalues" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Armenian-dram.jpg" alt="" width="393" height="295" />On 3 March 2009 in the space of a<em><strong> few hours</strong></em> the <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Armenian_Currency_FreeFalls_As_Central_Bank_Ends_Intervention/1503438.html" target="_blank">Armenian dram</a> evaporated from about 300 per dollar to about 400 per dollar and 275,000 drams per ounce of gold to approximately 365,000 drams per ounce of gold.  This rapid 30% currency poofing is like when the <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/02/kazakhstan-currency-goes-poof/" target="_blank">Kazakhstan currency went poof</a> but without the strategic geo-political considerations.  Nevertheless, <strong><em>extremely ominous</em></strong> financial troubles stir in Eastern Europe.  One knows the conditions are dire when Armenian Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan advocates using the <a href="http://ditord.com/2009/02/11/armenian-pm-it-is-in-interests-of-armenia-to-introduce-cis-regional-currency/" target="_blank">Russian ruble as a stable currency</a>.</p>
<p>As fiat currencies represent the common stock of nations; Armenia's future is omnious.  <a href="http://capital-en.trend.az/economy/macro/1434624.html" target="_blank">Trend Capital</a> has reported that Ogtay Hagverdiev, of the Azerbaijani Cabinet of Ministers Economy and Finance and Credit Policy Department head, said. "It will take time to restore the country's economy. A revolt among the people may begin in the meanwhile."</p>
<p>The Armenian government may soon default.  Rising prices, the effects of inflation, will soon begin.  Shortages, a common effect of currency problems, may appear.  Civil unrest may follow like in <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/11/civil-unrest-in-iceland/" target="_blank">Iceland</a>, <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/12/civil-unrest-in-greece/" target="_blank">Greece</a> and <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/12/civil-unrest-in-china-and-empty-ships/" target="_blank">China</a>.</p>
<p><strong>JUNCTION POINTS</strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Large buildings in urban environments are often constructed in such a way to reduce the effects, such as sound, of the outside.<span>  </span>It can be inspiring to sit in perfect silence without any sound to be heard coming from the bustling outside streets.<span>  </span>How is this silence possible with the hustle and bustle of a metropolis only a few yards away?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The answer lies in the construction.<span>  </span>For example, an inner building can be built within the walls of an existing building with the walls of the inner building connected to the outside building at only a few junction points.<span>  </span>This will greatly limit the effects of the hustling and bustling metropolis.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The investor can learn a lesson.<span>  </span>The reduction of junction points with businesses, organizations and governments can greatly reduce various risks to one’s capital and their effect on one’s personal life.<span>  If the relationship is no longer mutually advantageous then a</span>ny attachment through junction points should be easily severed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Defining one’s throughput and then implementing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0884271781?tag=run07-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0884271781&amp;adid=1NSM949FDFRFG816ZVY6&amp;" target="_blank">Theory of Constraints</a> thinking process can be extremely helpful in developing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307353133?tag=run07-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0307353133&amp;adid=0Q9F11VTEN7AK47F9EF0&amp;" target="_blank">Four Hour Workweek</a>.  This may allow one the freedom to live where, when and how they want.<span>  </span>The transitions accompanying the <a href="http://www.creditcontraction.com" target="_blank">great credit contraction</a> will provide tremendous opportunity for wealth generation and accumulation.<span>  </span>Being able to understand the environment will allow one to swim with, not against, the current.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the <a href="http://www.creditcontraction.com" target="_blank">great credit contraction</a> grinds on more fiat currency illusions, like the Armenian dram, Kazakhstan tenge or <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/01/bank-of-england-and-quantitative-easing/" target="_blank">British Pound</a>, will evaporate either wholly or partially.  As poet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Greenleaf_Whittier" target="_blank">John Greenleaf</a> wrote, "For all sad words of tongue and pen, The saddest are these, 'It might have been'."</p>
