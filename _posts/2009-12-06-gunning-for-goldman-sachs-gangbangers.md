<p><em>The world’s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money</em>. - Matt Taibbi, “<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/28816321/inside_the_great_american_bubble_machine">Inside the Great American Bubble Machine</a>”</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs (GS) gangbangers are engaged in public service, or more appropriately pillaging, as fast as possible even while the victims are getting increasingly shrill in their protests.  No means no and the gangbangers are not being respectful.  Bankers, financiers, hedge fund managers and others are being exterminated under suspicious circumstances.  Even senior gangbangers have issued guidelines for Goldman Sachs (GS) employees congregating in public.<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tracking_pixel.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tracking_pixel-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></p>
<p>You cannot make this stuff up.  So, in the culture of Goldman Sachs (GS), if their employees start getting exterminated then how will it affect the stock and how can the situation be played for profit?</p>
<p><strong>TENSENESS IN THE OFFICE</strong></p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs (GS) gangbanger's public pillaging is being increasingly revealed and the hundreds of millions, even billions, of people they have stolen from and wronged are getting rightfully upset.  This is bound to create some tenseness and nervousness around the gangbanger's hideout.  <a title="bloomberg" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;sid=ahD2WoDAL9h0#" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>'s Alice Schroeder, author of <a title="the snowball warren buffett" href="http://www.runtogold.com/thesnowballwarrenbuffettbook" target="_blank">The Snowball:  Warren Buffett and the Business of Life</a>, reports:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The banker had told this friend of mine that senior Goldman people have loaded up on firearms and are now equipped to defend themselves if there is a populist uprising against the bank. ... Has it really come to this? Imagine what emotions must be billowing through the halls of Goldman Sachs ...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The bailout was meant to keep the curtain drawn on the way the rich make money, not from the free market, but from the lack of one. Goldman Sachs blew its cover when the firm’s revenue from trading reached a record $27 billion in the first nine months of this year, and a public that was writhing in financial agony caught on that the profits earned on taxpayer capital were going to pay employee bonuses.</p>
<p>My the tangled web that Goldman Sachs (GS) gangbangers weave.</p>

<p><strong>WARNINGS</strong></p>
<p>Lloyd Blankfein, Chief Gangbanger for Goldman Sachs (GS) and whose <a title="goldman sachs wait in line" href="http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/item_VddIjS4IenJXTwP5ihUg1M" target="_blank">wife does not like to wait in line at charity events</a>, proclaimed that Goldman Sachs (GS) was 'doing God's work'.  Interestingly, <a title="goldman sachs god's work" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/33783316/?site=14081545" target="_blank">CNBC reported</a>, Lloyd Blankfein "added that he understood, however, that people were angry with bankers' actions: "I know I could slit my wrists and people would cheer."</p>

As the <a title="goldman sachs god's work" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-gregory/vatican-confirms-goldman_b_351688.html" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a> reported:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>L'Osservatore Romano</em> is reporting that Goldman Sachs is indeed Doing God's work, and His Former Holiness Joseph Ratzinger has confirmed the unsolicited hostile takeover. Writing under his pen name Benedict XVI, Ratzinger verified that total control of the popular religion has been transferred to Goldman Sachs and His New Holiness Lloyd Blankfein.</p>
<p>But seriously, the Bible has many examples from Elijah with the chariots of fire to Daniel in the lion's den of those who did God's work being protected.  And what type of work did Jesus do?  <a title="mark 11" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_11" target="_blank">Mark</a> records:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers</p>
<p>But instead of relying on God's protection the <a title="business insider" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-employees-arent-allowed-to-hang-out-in-groups-of-12-or-more-2009-11" target="_blank">Business Insider</a> has reported, "all Goldman Sachs employees received [voicemails] earlier this month. They were told not to organize small [12 maximum] parties even if no firm money goes to pay for them."</p>
<p>So during the holidays remember to keep that Christmas spirit.</p>
<p><strong>WAGING OF WAR</strong></p>
<p>During the <a title="panic of 1873" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1873" target="_blank">Panic of 1873</a> many investment houses went bankrupt.  Tensions got so heated the United States Army was deployed to New York City to protect the bankers.</p>
<p>When the rich wage war its the poor who die in Afghanistan but when the cake eating poor wage war its the rich who died in France.  This time around the Goldman Sachs (GS) gangbangers are going to want security provided by highly trained troops, or former troops, whose parent's pensions have been stolen and whose best friends have died in their arms in foreign lands.</p>
<p>A few days ago I was talking with a friend who had just returned from an overseas war deployment with the United States Navy.  I jokingly recounted how the armed forces protected the bankers in 1873 and asked him 'What would you do if ordered to protect the bankers?'  He jokingly replied to the effect, 'I would go, stand between the angry crowd and the banker and when the time was right I would grab the bankers and throw them to the crowd.'</p>
<p><strong>COINAGE ACT OF 1792</strong></p>
<p>The Founding Fathers were not impressed with the thieving advocates of paper currency.  They wrote specific safeguards into the United States Constitution.  Additionally, under the <a title="coinage act of 1792" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/01/1792-coinage-act/" target="_blank">Coinage Act of 1792</a> financial crimes, like the Goldman Sachs Gang is currently perpetrating, were severally punished under the <a title="1792 coinage act" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhldj52ZuUU" target="_blank">1792 Coinage Act</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">SEC. 19. <em>And be it further enacted</em>, That if any of the gold or silver coins which shall be struck or coined at the said mint shall be debased or made worse as to the proportion of fine gold or fine silver therein contained, or shall be of less weight or value than the same ought to be pursuant to the directions of this act, through the default or with the connivance of any of the officers or persons who shall be employed at the said mint, for the purpose of profit or gain, or otherwise with a fraudulent intent, and if any of the said officers or persons shall embezzle any of the metals which shall at any time be committed to their charge for the purpose of being coined, or any of the coins which shall be struck or coined at the said mint, every such officer or person who shall commit any or either of the said offences, shall be deemed guilty of felony, and <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">shall suffer death</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Because of the current lack of legal protection primarily due to the <a title="deep capture" href="http://www.deepcapture.com" target="_blank">deep capture</a> of the political machinery by these parasitic vampire squids therefore it appears that the victims have begun resorting to vigilantism.  What other possible recourse do they have against such immoral and unjustified aggressors?</p>
<p><strong>EXTERMINATED VAMPIRE SQUIDS</strong></p>
<p>I can understand why the leading gangbangers at Goldman Sachs (GS) are getting nervous as the number of parasitic vampire squids that have been exterminated keeps growing.  <a title="andrei kozlov" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5345236.stm" target="_blank">Andrei Kozlov</a>, Russian central banker, was riddled with bullets.  Dead hedge fund managers include <a title="seth tobias" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=3957928&amp;pa" target="_blank">Seth Tobias</a>, <a title="oleg zhukovsky" href="http://rt.com/Business/2007-12-07/Police_investigate_murder_of_top_banker.html" target="_blank">Oleg Zhukovsky</a>, <a title="rene thierry magon de la villehuchet" href="http://blackpoliticalthought.blogspot.com/2008/12/rene-thierry-magon-de-la-villehuchet.html" target="_blank">Rene-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet</a>, <a title="michael klein" href="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7009542556" target="_blank">Michael Klein</a>, <a title="peter wuffli" href="http://www.euromoney.com/Article/1392285/Abigail-Hofman-Murder.html?Type=Article&amp;ArticleID=1392285&amp;single=true" target="_blank">Peter Wuffli</a> and <a title="kirk wright" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/02/sports/football/02wright.html?_r=3&amp;em&amp;ex=1212552000&amp;en=8" target="_blank">Kirk Wright</a>.</p>
<p>The list goes on.  It includes <a title="david kellerman" href="http://gothamist.com/2009/04/22/freddie_mac_cfo_dead_in_apparent_su.php" target="_blank">David Kellerman</a>, Freddie Mac CFO and even <a title="james macdonald" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE58E1BV20090915" target="_blank">James MacDonald</a> the CEO of the Rockefeller family offices.  I suppose we should wish their famlies the best; except for New York tax attorney <a title="william parente" href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_meVIgZ1ysyERMdTEHTxJjK" target="_blank">William Parente</a>.  Whoever he angered worked corruption of blood and his wife and two children were also murdered.  There are many more examples.  My advice to them:  Get out of dodge and take a vacation to <a title="cape cod" href="http://www.capeguide.com/" target="_blank">Cape Cod</a>.  Look, I am a poet and did not know it.</p>
<p><strong>SERVICE BUSINESS</strong></p>
<p>Goldman Sachs (GS) is primarily a service business and dependent upon the individuals who receive an <a title="goldman sachs average bonus" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/oct/15/goldman-sachs-record-bonus-pot" target="_blank">average bonus</a> of about $700,000 from a total pot of <strong>$16.7B</strong>.  When a company's workforce is so universally hated and have wronged so many millions, even billions, of people there is a possibility that retribution will be taken.  If retribution is taken then how could that affect earnings and how could the company benefit from the unfortunate circumstances?</p>
<p>Wall Street is full of sociopaths and you cannot grow a conscience if you do not have one.  Unfortunately, for this exercise we will have to analyze like the Goldman Sachs (GS) gangbangers; with the lack of a moral compass.</p>
<p><strong>Key-man insurance</strong> can be described as an insurance policy taken out by a business to compensate that business for financial losses that would arise from the death or extended incapacity of the individual specified on the policy. The policy’s term usually does not extend beyond the period of the key person’s usefulness to the business. The aim is to compensate the business for losses and facilitate business continuity.</p>
<p>Not only is there a very real threat to Goldman Sachs (GS) gangbangers from the outside, evidenced by the weapons permits and limitations on sizes of gatherings, but there is a potential conflict of interest from the inside.  Sure, if Goldman Sachs (GS) gangbangers were to start targeting their own employees to benefit from key-man insurance it would be illegal and they should be prevented from receiving proceeds because of killer and slayer statutes.</p>
<p>But perhaps the gangbangers will get their vassal politicians to create ex-post facto legislation to provide immunity.  As <a title="cnet" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10256929-38.html" target="_blank">CNET</a> reported:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A federal judge in San Francisco has tossed out a slew of lawsuits filed against AT&amp;T and other telecommunications companies alleged to have illegally opened their networks to the National Security Agency.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker on Wednesday ruled that, thanks to a 2008 federal law retroactively immunizing those companies, approximately 46 lawsuits brought by civil liberties groups and class action lawyers will be dismissed.</p>
<p>Which employees should the upper brass target?  If you have spent the last 5-15 years putting in 80-100 hour weeks then how much would you sell your health for?  An even better question may be how much would your boss sell your health for?  Why should they share profits with you?</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs gangbangers are among the largest hordes of parasitic vampire squids on the planet.  The absence of their aggressive theft would increase the standard of living for millions even billions of humans.  As a peacemaker who believes that force should never be used aggressively against innocent people or their legitimately acquired property I would prefer to <a title="starve vampire squids" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/11/starving-the-vampire-squids/" target="_blank">starve the vampire squids</a> I am opposed to and not be an instrument of extermination.  It is unfortunate that the parasitic Goldman Sachs Gang has been and continues to be so aggressive that their host victims may feel they have no other choice than to act in self defense by gunning for Goldman Sachs gangbangers.</p>
<p>Should this happen then through the use of key-man insurance and ex post facto legislation to provide immunity for illegal behavior the Goldman Sachs Gang can tremendously increase the gang's profitability and the bonus share for the senior partners.  If the gang's leaders do happen to find themselves in an uncomfortable situation then they will likely be bailed out, if possible.  Nevertheless, I would not tamper with such a filthy instrument either way.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLOSURES</strong>:  Long physical <a title="buying gold" href="http://www.runtogold.com/how-to-buy-gold-or-silver/" target="_blank">gold</a> but neither long nor short GS and neither long nor short (except for being a US citizen) any GS employees.</p>
