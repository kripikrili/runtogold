<p>Investor Jim Sinclair is very upset with the Wall Street Sociopaths and their manufacturing of OTC derivatives which are financial weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>A sociopath is a person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior and a lack of conscience.  Most mass murders are sociopaths.  Sociopaths are extremely dangerous to society.</p>
