<p>Mr. Al Korelin was gracious enough to take a few minutes to interview myself  <a href="http://runtogold.com/sounds/TraceMayerOnKorelinJune212008.mp3">(mp3)</a> and Dr. Irv Arenberg at the <a href="http://cambridgehouse.ca/ch_june2008.html" target="_blank">Cambridge House Investment Conference</a> June 15-16, 2008.  My portion focuses on some basic issues of monetary science and theory.</p>
<p><span>A few months ago Dr. Arenberg and I had a nice conversation in DC so it was good to see a right thinking person again.  For brevity I have included only my portion of the interview.  The <a href="http://www.kereport.com/" target="_blank">Korelin Economics Report</a> has the <a href="http://www.kereport.com/audio/0621-03.mp3" target="_blank">complete show</a> with both Dr. Arenberg and I or just my portion <a href="http://runtogold.com/sounds/TraceMayerOnKorelinJune212008.mp3">(mp3)</a>.</span></p>
