<p><strong>10 DOLLAR GOLD COIN VALUE</strong></p>
<p>The 10 dollar gold coin, an American gold eagle, has a gold coin value of $10 in terms of legal tender but a <em>fluctuating</em> market value which can be realized by dealing with a reputable gold coin dealer like <a title="10 dollar gold coin value" href="http://www.runtogold.com/10dollargoldcoinvalue" target="_blank">GoldSilver</a>.  This is a prime example of how a gold coins value can be different in the market as opposed to its legal tender status. One problem is because the question <a title="what is a dollar" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/05/define-the-dollar-or-else/" target="_blank">What Is A Dollar?</a> has no intelligible answer.</p>
<p><strong>AMERICAN GOLD EAGLE COIN</strong></p>
<p>The Mint of the United States began production of the American eagle 22 karat gold bullion coin in 1986. The metallic composition is 91.67% gold, 3% silver and 5.33% copper and there are several denominations such as a <a title="5 dollar gold coin value" href="http://www.runtogold.com/how-to-buy-gold-or-silver/5-dollar-gold-coin-value-gold-coin-dealer/" target="_blank">5 dollar gold coin</a>, <a title="25 dollar gold coin value" href="http://www.runtogold.com/how-to-buy-gold-or-silver/25-dollar-gold-coin-value-gold-coin-dealer/" target="_blank">25 dollar gold coin</a> and <a title="50 dollar gold coin value" href="http://www.runtogold.com/how-to-buy-gold-or-silver/50-dollar-gold-coin-value-gold-coin-dealer/" target="_blank">50 dollar gold coin</a>:</p>

<p><strong>HEAD SIDE</strong> Lady Liberty is shown on the heads side and based on a $20 gold coin, the "Double Eagle", that was designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens and produced between 1907 and 1933. WIth a torch in her right hand representing enlightenment and the symbol of peace in the left hand, an olive branch, Lady Liberty is a potent symbol.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="10 dollar gold coins value tail" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/10-dollar-gold-coin-values-tail.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p><strong>TAIL SIDE</strong> A hovering male eagle and sitting female eagle with two baby eagles is on the tails side. The male eagle also has an olive branch symbolizing peace. Inscribed is the national motto of the United States of America: IN GOD WE TRUST. Also engraved is the Great Seal of the United States along with the motto "E PLURIBUS UNUM" which is Latin for "Out of Many, One".</p>
<p>Under <a title="united states code" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/5112.html" target="_blank">31 USC 5,112</a> the gold used to mint these coins must be mined in the United States. Oddly, only 46 stars appear which is the same as on the Double Eagle gold coins which represents the number of states in 1907. A new coin has been authorized by former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and it will have 50 stars.</p>
