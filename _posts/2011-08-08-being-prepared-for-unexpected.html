<p><strong>[pullquote]When the time for performance comes the time for preparation has passed.[/pullquote]</strong>Gold has powered higher at an incredible and, for many, unexpected rate going from FRN$1,658.75 in the 5 Aug PM London fix to FRN$1,761.50 at 6am 9 Aug London time. The DOW:GOLD ratio has plummeted to around 6.15. Hope you are strapped in because turbulence is ahead!<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/090811.jpg" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></p>
<p>I recently finished two weeks in London which ended with the <a title="gata gold rush london conference" href="http://www.gata.org" target="_blank">GATA Gold Rush 2011 conference</a>. I was in the room during the taping of the Jim Sinclair interview. How right has he been all along!</p>
<p>The flat I rented in London was about two tube stops from the Tottenham riots. Now I am in Athens headed to the islands for an enjoyable two weeks. With all the turmoil I often wonder: Do the riots follow me or do I follow the riots?</p>
<p>One common theme on <a title="run to gold" href="http://www.runtogold.com" target="_blank">RunToGold</a> is to assess the probability and gravity risks, analyze potential solutions or plans and then take action with <a title="provident living principles" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/08/provident-living-principles/" target="_blank">provident living principles</a> which may lead to <a title="survivalism in the suburbs" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/05/survivalism-in-the-suburbs/" target="_blank">survivalism in the suburbs</a> or some other form of <a title="life hedge" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2011/04/la-estancia-de-cafayate-the-great-life-hedge-in-salta-argentina/" target="_blank">life hedge</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UNITED STATES LOSES TRIPLE A RATING</strong></p>
<p>In April Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was asked concerning the risk of the U.S. losing its triple-A credit rating: Secretary Geithner replied, "No risk of that."</p>
<p>Then the politicians bickered about the debt ceiling and came to a faux resolution. On 5 August 2011 the <a title="wall street journal" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903366504576490841235575386.html" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> reported:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">S&amp;P removed for the first time the triple-A rating the U.S. has held for 70 years, saying the budget deal recently brokered in Washington didn't do enough to address the gloomy outlook for America's finances. It downgraded long-term U.S. debt to AA+, a score that ranks below more than a dozen governments'</p>
<p>Boom, Boom, Pow!</p>
<p><strong>[pullquote]Those persuaded have likely ensconced themselves within a financial forcefield of silver and gold.[/pullquote]THE GREAT CREDIT CONTRACTION INTENSIFIES</strong></p>
<p>In <a title="2009" href="http://www.jsmineset.com/2009/03/19/in-the-news-today-142/" target="_blank">2009</a> Mr. Sinclair said of my liquidity pyramid: <em>"A very good, simple and clear representation of the problem lacking a practical solution."</em> Before his interview at the GATA conference I wanted to thank him for his gracious compliment. Regarding the liquidity pyramid Mr. Sinclair remarked, "Perfect."</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="liquidity pyramid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Liquidity-Pyramid.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="497" /></p>
<p><strong>PREPARATION, CONFIDENCE AND CALM</strong></p>
<p>I have received a tremendous increase in comments and emails from readers and friends. They all seem to want expert advice from someone who knows what is going on. Why do you think I wrote <em>hundreds</em> of articles on Run To Gold? When the time for performance comes the time for preparation has passed.</p>
<p>I really wish I could provide some advice for those 'caught between a rock and a hard place' who are watching their pensions and retirement accounts evaporate. But I am off swimming in the beautiful islands of the Mediterranean Sea and do not have ready access to the phone.</p>
<p>Those darn <em>crazy</em> gold bugs do not look so crazy now. How right was Mr. Sinclair when he called $1,650 gold a <em>decade</em> ago when it was around $265? Good thing his thin skin is gold-plated.</p>
<p>But I have already written about the <a title="evaporating euro" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2010/04/euro-gold-and-the-euro-zone/" target="_blank">evaporating Euro</a>, how <a title="retirement accounts could boost treasuries" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2010/01/retirement-accounts-could-boost-treasuries/" target="_blank">retirement accounts could boost Treasuries</a> and as I wrote in 18 January 2009 <a title="why and how the treasury bubble will burst" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/01/why-and-how-the-treasury-bubble-will-burst/" target="_blank">why and how the Treasury bubble will burst</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As the yields on Treasury Bills approach 0% they have the return of cash but do not have the benefits of cash as they may be impregnated with counter-party risk or have decreased liquidity.  In other words, Treasury Bills and cash have the same benefit profile but not the same safety and liquidity profile.</p>
<p>The <a title="wall street journal" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903366504576488123965468018.html" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> reported 4 August 2011 that "Bank of New York Mellon Corp. on Thursday took the extraordinary step of telling large clients it will charge them [0.13%] to hold cash."</p>
<p>Now the FRN$ moves one step closer to evaporating. Why pay <strong>0.13%</strong> to hold FRN$ when you can pay a <strong>0.18%</strong> storage fee to hold unencumbered allocated insured gold? Is it really wise or prudent to save five basis points to be in a potentially worthless fiat currency while being an unsecured creditor of an institution(s) that has needed trillions in bailouts? Treasuries are not looking so <em>risk-free</em> are they?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="forcefield" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/forcefield.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="348" /></p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>What is happening is no real surprise to those who understand monetary science and basic economic law. I laid out the case years ago in my book <a title="the great credit contraction" href="http://www.creditcontraction.com" target="_blank">The Great Credit Contraction</a>. Those persuaded have likely ensconced themselves within a financial forcefield of silver and gold.</p>
<p>As the storm rages and intensifies they feel no particular urgency or panic. They are prepared for <a title="kondratieff winter" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/02/first-snowfall-of-kondratieff-winter/" target="_blank">Winter</a> and can remain solvent much longer than the market can remain chaotic. After all, the melting point for gold is 1,947.52 °F which may be its FRN$ after this latest up leg.</p>
<p>For those who are new, I recommend <a title="Apmex" href="http://www.runtogold.com/apmex090811" target="_blank">Apmex</a> for coins because of their A+ BBB rating and low premiums and <a title="goldmoney" href="http://www.runtogold.com/goldmoney" target="_blank">GoldMoney</a> if you want a third-party to store your metals.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLOSURES: </strong>Long physical gold, silver and platinum with no interest in DOW, S&amp;P 500, the problematic SLV ETF, <a title="gld etf" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/02/another-problem-with-the-gld-etf/" target="_blank">gold ETF</a> or the <a title="platinum" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2010/01/is-platinum-overvalued/" target="_blank">platinum</a> ETFs.</p>
