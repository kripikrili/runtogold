<p><strong>BOOK REVIEW:  WHAT HAS GOVERNMENT DONE TO OUR MONEY</strong></p>
<p>On 25 June 2009 I was invited to the <a style="color: #8e3900; text-decoration: underline;" title="cafe libertalia" href="http://www.cafelibertalia.com/" target="_blank">Cafe Libertalia</a> to speak at a book club where I was given the latitude to choose the book for discussion.  I picked <a title="what has government done to our money" href="http://www.runtogold.com/whathasgovernmentdonetoourmoneybook" target="_blank">What Has Government Done To Our Money And The Case For A 100% Gold Dollar</a> by Murray Rothbard. This book is an easy to read foundation for the student of the Austrian school of economics.  Therefore, I think everyone should get and read a copy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.runtogold.com/whathasgovernmentdonetoourmoneybook" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" title="what has government done to our money" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/what-has-government-done-to-our-money.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="256" /></a></p>
<p>What Has Government Done To Our Money is 119 pages while The Case For A 100% Gold Dollar is 61 pages.  It is printed on archival quality acid-free paper and has a sleek cover.  This book makes a great addition to any library.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAS GOVERNMENT DONE TO OUR MONEY</strong></p>
<p>This is a well done objective monetary history.  It discusses how money developed, the rise of fractional reserve banking and the constant meddling by government in money and currency.  A key reason governments meddle in the money and currency markets is because it is a source of funding.</p>
<p>The reader learns some some basics of history, government and economics such as the development of monetary names, benefits of money, a short discussion on legal tender application and an entire part on The Monetary Breakdown of the West.</p>
<p><strong>THE CASE FOR A 100% GOLD DOLLAR</strong></p>
<p>This is a persuasive essay on why a 100% gold Dollar should be adopted.  This essay originally appeared in the out of print and hard to find <a title="in search of a monetary constitution" href="http://www.runtogold.com/insearchofamonetaryconstitutionbook" target="_blank">In Search Of A Monetary Constitution</a> by Leland Yeager and published in 1962 by the Harvard University Press.  While the arguments Rothbard makes are sound; I do not really agree because of advances in information technology and monetary evolution over the past 47 years.</p>
<p>Four and a half decades ago there was no Fandango, online checkin for airplane flights, etc.  So likewise there have been advances made in monetary application and I am of the opinion that private digital commodity currencies, like <a title="goldmoney how to buy gold or silver" href="http://www.runtogold.com/goldmoney" target="_blank">GoldMoney</a>, provide the most efficient solution to the monetary chaos the world has found itself in.</p>
<p><strong>WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR</strong></p>
<p><a title="what has government done to our money" href="http://www.runtogold.com/whathasgovernmentdonetoourmoneybook" target="_blank">What Has Government Done To Our Money And The Case For A 100% Gold Dollar</a> by Murray Rothbard is a quick and easy read divided into two main portions.  I think the objective presentation of monetary history is a good read for anybody.  The persuasive essay is a good read for anyone who wants to stimulate their analytical capacities; but keep in mind the essay is obsolete.  Therefore, I think everyone should get and read a copy of this book.</p>
<p>You can get a <a title="what has government done to our money" href="http://mises.org/money.asp" target="_blank">free digital copy</a> from the Mises Institute or purchase a physical copy from <a title="what has government done to our money" href="http://www.runtogold.com/whathasgovernmentdonetoourmoneybook" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p>
