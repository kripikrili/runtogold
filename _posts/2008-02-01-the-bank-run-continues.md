<p>As discussed with the <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/01/banks-have-negative-reserve-ratios/">negative real reserve ratios</a> the US banking system is currently experiencing a Bank Run and withdrawals are being met with printing the money out of thin air.  <strong>The <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/02/first-snowfall-of-kondratieff-winter/">Kondratieff Winter</a></strong><strong> has started and the snow is already falling.</strong></p>
<p><span>From <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080201/fed_credit_crisis.html" target="_blank">Yahoo</a>:</span></p>
<p><span>”The Federal Reserve said Friday it will provide $60 billion in fresh cash to commercial banks in two auctions in February and will keep holding auctions every other week for as long as needed to ease the credit crisis.</span></p>
<p><span>The new auctions, to be held on Feb. 11 and Feb. 25, will mark the fifth and sixth times the Fed has used a new auction process announced in December to provide cash-strapped banks with extra reserves.</span></p>
<p><span>In a brief statement, the Fed said that it intended to keep holding the auctions every other week "for as long as necessary to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets."</span></p>
