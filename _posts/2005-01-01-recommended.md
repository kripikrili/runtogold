<p><span>This site’s primary purpose is to educate on monetary science and theory.  Strong conflicts of interest exist so this area has been obfuscated, hidden and confounded.  For example, the <strong>current banking system is inherently unsound</strong>.  If one wants to learn the truth about money they must learn it on their own.  As a result, the basic laws of monetary science are largely unknown.</span></p>
<p><span>The current instability in the financial markets is predictable according to the laws of monetary science.  Like gravity, the current consequences, including all the violent wars, have been experienced throughout history.</span></p>
<p><span>Commodity money like gold are not mere commodities but essential checks and balances in political machinery.  The root cause of almost all current societal problems is unsound currency.  A sound monetary system promotes a sound, safe and productive society.</span></p>
