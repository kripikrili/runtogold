excerpt: The old guard of postal services is fading to Internet enabled firms during
  the great credit contraction.
---
<p>Technology keeps thrusting forward at an ever increasing rate as the Information Age transforms the world at a rapid pace.  Business is happening at the speed of thought as companies are beginning to morph into digital entities in a physical world.  Fortunes have already been made in supply chain management and product distribution as evidenced with Toyota and WalMart.  With top lines under constant pressure as the credit contraction grinds on increased efficiency is being eked out of every possible source.</p>
<p>Man's financial progress is a function of effort times tools.  Business has, is and will be the primary tool to generate wealth.  The 'job', a relic of the Industrial Age, is rapidly being replaced with outsourced freelancers.  Millions of Americans have lost their jobs in recent months.</p>
<p>This vast pool of usually skilled workers are now navigating a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0060776099?tag=run07-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0060776099&amp;adid=1903SPHVE9MBNFE4WA4D&amp;" target="_blank">brave new world</a>.  While hundreds apply for a single job; an exponentially expanding web invites the adventurous and rewards the productive.  Never in the history of the world has there been such powerful <a href="http://www.internet-based-business-mastery.com/1landing/3pillars/podcast/index.htm?aid=1podcast&amp;bid=c497b816" target="_blank">Internet marketing</a> tools available to the lone entrepreneur to leverage their productivity.</p>
<p><strong>THE OLD ORDER</strong></p>
<p>Creative destruction is taking place in almost every aspect of the the economy from the exciting realm of <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/03/newspapers-evaporating-at-tremendous-speeds/" target="_blank">newspapers and journalism</a> to the mundane of postal and package delivery.  The United States Postal Service enjoys a substantial monopoly imposed by Federal law.  Predictably this system has catered to special interests with their army of lobbyists.  That is the reason most receive tons of dirty and annoying advertising SPAM in the mailboxes that waste their time and like most <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/02/sound-money-and-the-environment/" target="_blank">governmental policies harm the environment</a>.</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aWY.glqpklgI&amp;refer=home" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> reports that "The U.S. Postal Service said it will offer early retirement to about 150,000 workers ... In the past year the service has taken 'very aggressive cost-cutting actions,' including a nationwide hiring freeze and halting construction of new postal facilities, according to the statement.  Potter [Postmaster General] asked Congress in January to let the Postal Service reduce its six-days-a-week delivery schedule by one day to save money."</p>
<p>Why does postal mail, the vast majority of it SPAM, need to be <strong>physically</strong> delivered even once a week?  Why does an address in north Alaska cost the <strong>same</strong> to deliver to as one in Los Angeles?  Legislative interferences in the marketplace to prop up failing institutions lead to expensive moral hazard, inefficient systems, poor customer service and a lower quality of product.  Is the use of violence to perpetuate this failing system moral?</p>
<p><strong>THE NEW ORDER</strong></p>
<p>With the advent of the Internet the delivery of postal mail and packages can be accomplished with greater efficiency.  Through innovative Internet-powered CMRAs (Commercial Mail Receiving Agency), customers can view images of their envelopes in email or online and have their mail securely scanned into a PDF, recycled, shredded, or forwarded.  For the <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/10/gold-privacy-and-constitutional-rights/" target="_blank">privacy minded</a>, like victims of spousal abuse, etc. the <a href="http://www.howtovanish.com" target="_blank">ability to vanish</a> using this type of <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/get-a-ghost-address/" target="_blank">ghost address</a> is extremely valuable.</p>
<p>As the <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=711" target="_blank">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a> reports, "States are facing a great fiscal crisis.  At least 47 states faced or are facing shortfalls in their budgets for this and/or next year, and severe fiscal problems are highly likely to continue into the following year as well.  Combined budget gaps for the remainder of this fiscal year and state fiscal years 2010 and 2011 are estimated to total more than $350 billion."</p>
<p>Many individuals have their own budget with policy priorities and given all the <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=94750" target="_blank">Tea Parties</a>, I highly doubt it involves paying more taxes than legally required.  For example, customers can easily have the ability to receive packages in states like Oregon where there is no sales tax, forward the package using <a href="http://www.fedex.com" target="_blank">Fedex</a> or the <a href="http://www.ups.com" target="_blank">United Parcel Service, Inc.</a> (UPS), and the savings would likely be greater than the cost of an entire year of the service.  This may slightly perturb some States, which are <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/01/state-budget-shortfalls-and-safety-deposit-boxes/" target="_blank">breaking into safety deposit boxes and auctioning the contents on Ebay</a>, resulting in greater enforcement of sales and use tax laws but that will likely be very difficult.</p>
<p>Ebay and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307353133?tag=run07-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0307353133&amp;adid=0Q9F11VTEN7AK47F9EF0&amp;" target="_blank">Amazon</a> are simply digital flea markets and the <a href="http://www.digitalnomads.com/" target="_blank">digital nomad</a> can finish all their work at a <a href="http://www.fedex.com/us/office/" target="_blank">Fedex Office</a>.  The Internet entrepreneur relies on package tracking to ensure their products and sold on the digital flea markets are delivered.  And so it happens that business goes offline to online and online to offline.</p>
<p><strong>DIGITAL BEHEMOTHS</strong></p>
<p>Most people think of Ebay, Amazon and Google as the digital behemoths.  But <a href="http://www.fedex.com/us/office/" target="_blank">Fedex</a> CEO Frederick Smith understood the future with his long-held mantra that "The information about a package is as important as the package itself."  Fedex and UPS are as much information management companies as they are shipping companies.  They have large, deep and formidable moats that will prevent competitors from siphoning market share.</p>
<p>Their charts are likewise similar:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" title="UPS stock chart" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/UPS-April-13.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="482" /><img class="aligncenter" title="Fedex Stock Chart" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/UPS-April-13.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="482" />While <a href="http://pittsburgh.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2009/04/06/daily1.html?ana=yfcpc" target="_blank">Fedex has recently laid off 1,000</a> of its 223,400 employees both it and UPS, which is expanding <a href="http://dayton.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/2009/04/06/daily38.html?ana=yfcpc" target="_blank">door-to-door service in Mexico</a>, will be around generating profits for a long time.  But the current administration is <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/03/how-to-intentionally-exacerbate-the-greater-depression/" target="_blank">exacerbating the greater depression</a> which will drag down their earnings.  <strong>So when will UPS and Fedex shares be a good value?  </strong>Gold is the <strong>most</strong> reliable instrument for <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/08/value-calculation/" target="_blank">calculating value</a> and is being re-enthroned as a <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/goldmoney" target="_blank">currency in ordinary daily transactions</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignright" title="Fedex and UPS logos" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Fedex-UPS.gif" alt="" width="238" height="138" />Creative destruction is taking place at a rapid pace during the Information Age.  Many <a href="http://www.internetbusinessmastery.com/" target="_blank">Internet marketing tools</a> are available for the entrepreneur.  Services like <a href="http://www.myearthclassmail.com" target="_blank">Earth Class Mail</a>, which exist through voluntary relationships, will rise.  The old State sponsored monopolies enforced through violence will fall.  Fedex and UPS are digital behemoths which will play a critical role in the new online to offline and offline to online economy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the great <a href="http://www.creditcontraction.com" target="_blank">credit contraction</a> continues the top lines of firms will be under extreme pressure and will most likely affect Fedex and UPS while the FRN$ will continue its wild fluctuations in purchasing power.  Therefore, while Fedex and UPS are solid companies with a bright future they should get materially cheaper, at 1.1gg and 1.25gg per share respectively, before they become a good value.  They will most likely be back there again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Disclosures:  Long physical gold and silver with no position in UPS, FDX, or the other firms mentioned.</p>
