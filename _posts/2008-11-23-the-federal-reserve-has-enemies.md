<p>I recently wrote about how civil unrest has started in Iceland.  The rallies started small with about 500 people and steadily grew over a couple months to about 8,000 which represents about 2.5% of their total population.  On November 22, 2008 the Federal Reserve had some protestors.  <br/><br/>Like Iceland it is starting out small with only a few hundred at each of location (Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco).  Additionally, other rallies took place at other Federal Reserve locations from Jacksonville, FL to Los Angeles.  In total it is estimated there were over 15,000 protestors.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve is an unconstitutional monetary system that allows for confiscation through inflation without representation.  Under the <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/01/1792-coinage-act/">1792 Coinage Act</a> governmental actors perpetrating this type of a fraud would be subject to the death penalty.</p>
<p>In October in Toronto with <a href="http://cambridgehouse.ca/ch_tor2008.html" target="_blank">Cambridge House</a> I was asked a question during the panel session before several thousand people about what the average person could do.  I said, "That light at the end of the tunnel is just the next train.  <br/><br/>Get out of the way!  Get 3 months worth of food in your house.  Have some place to go should supply chains be interrupted.  Have a plan should civil unrest develop."  That night at dinner like usual I sat next to Jim Willie a PhD in Statistics who did forecasting for life insurance companies.  I dare not even mention his dire prediction.</p>
<p>Gerald Celente, president of <a href="http://www.trendsresearch.com/news.html">Trends Research Institute</a>, is a highly acclaimed and accurate trend forecaster.  He has recently made the following prediction:</p>
<p>“There will be a revolution in this country,” he said. “It’s not going to come yet, but it’s going to come down the line and we’re going to see a third party and this was the catalyst for it: the takeover of Washington, D. C., in broad daylight by Wall Street in this bloodless coup. And it will happen as conditions continue to worsen.”</p>
<p>“The first thing to do is organize with tax revolts. That’s going to be the big one because people can’t afford to pay more school tax, property tax, any kind of tax. You’re going to start seeing those kinds of protests start to develop.”</p>
<p>“It’s going to be very bleak. Very sad. And there is going to be a lot of homeless, the likes of which we have never seen before. Tent cities are already sprouting up around the country and we’re going to see many more.”</p>
<p>“We’re going to start seeing huge areas of vacant real estate and squatters living in them as well. It’s going to be a picture the likes of which Americans are not going to be used to.<br/><br/> It’s going to come as a shock and with it, there’s going to be a lot of crime. And the crime is going to be a lot worse than it was before because in the last 1929 Depression, people’s minds weren’t wrecked on all these modern drugs – over-the-counter drugs, or crystal meth or whatever it might be. So, you have a huge underclass of very desperate people with their minds chemically blown beyond anybody’s comprehension.”</p>

<p>No one knows what lies ahead.  Our future is not etched in stone yet.  Unemployment plus discouraged workers is getting ludicrous.  However, many societies have traveled the path of a currency collapse before.  The critical question will once again be posed: <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/10/glenn-beck-discusses-hyperinflation/"><strong>Repression or Regeneration</strong></a><strong>?</strong>  Plenty of people are now echoing the warning that many of us have been sounding for a long time.  I recommend preparing according to your own risk tolerance.  Perhaps the most dangerous state to be in is denial. <br/><br/> If history is any guide it always appears that the issuers of the currency are always the last to accept that their is a problem with it.</p>
