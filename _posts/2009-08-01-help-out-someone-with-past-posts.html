<p>These past several weeks have been fairly volatile with gold ranging from $910 to 955 and platinum ranging from about $1,100 to $1,225.  As I wrote about in the latest article, <a title="the coming market crash" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/07/the-coming-market-crash/" target="_blank">The Coming Market Crash</a>, this autumn will most likely have some fireworks.  As now is a relatively calm period I think it would be wise to take an inventory of where we have come, review some of the past posts and get prepared for the fall.</p>
<p>With over 150 posts on <a title="runtogold" href="http://www.runtogold.com" target="_blank">RunToGold</a> the archives can be daunting.  As there are constantly new readers I think it would be good to point out some of the better articles.  In response to a reader request a few weeks ago I added an <strong>email option to all posts</strong>.  Several readers have used this tool to inform and help others they care about.</p>
<p><strong>READER COMMENTS</strong></p>
<p>"My father is a smart man, CPA, successful entrepreneur, and believes that deflation is what lies ahead. Therefore, there is a real problem with differences in our ideas about what to do going forward.  Your recent article “<a title="dollar in hyperinflation" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/08/us-dollar-in-hyperinflation/" target="_blank">US Dollar in Hyperinflation</a>” makes my point (better than I ever could!). I sent him a link to your article". (my analysis of the <a title="inflation or deflation" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/07/inflation-with-gary-north-or-deflation-with-mish/" target="_blank">Inflation or Deflation</a> argument)</p>
<p>"Saw your article on ’<a title="silver backwardation" href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/02/five-weeks-of-silver-backwardation/" target="_blank">silver backwardation</a>’.  Very informative!"</p>
<p>"Trace, Thanks for your information and work. You have some really useful information and charts.  Best regards, TS; Hong Kong".</p>
