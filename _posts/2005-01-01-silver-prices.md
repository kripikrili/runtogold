<h1>THE SPOT SILVER PRICE TODAY</h1>
<p>The <strong>silver price</strong> today can vary widely in the spot silver market. The silver prices today are shown below in troy ounces. 1 troy ounce = 31.1034768 grams. I recommended buying silver when it was "<a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/12/oil-majors-should-just-buy-real-gold/">extremely cheap</a>" around $10.50 per ounce, have followed it through <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/02/voracious-indian-silver-appetite/">backwardation</a> with <strong>gains over 50%</strong> and am still fond of the white metal. The 200DMA is the 200 day moving average. The Relative number is the current price divided by the 200DMA. This shows whether the metals are cheap, average value, expensive or really expensive. The goal is to buy low and sell high.</p>
