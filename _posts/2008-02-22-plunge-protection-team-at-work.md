<p>As many of you are aware the<a href="http://www.rense.com/general52/secretsoftheplunge.htm" target="_blank"> Plunge Protection Team</a>, officially know as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_Group_on_Financial_Markets" target="_blank">President’s Working Group on Financial Markets</a>, is used to intervene in markets.  <br/><br/>This ‘invisible hand’ causes inefficient allocations of capital which lead to a lower of standard of living.  What is even more dangerous is the threat to our civil liberties that can result from interference in the markets for political reasons.  While the above chart typifies the deflation of financial asset prices the following chart shows the hyperinflation of tangible asset prices.  These two monstrous forces colliding are resulting in quite the show!</p>
