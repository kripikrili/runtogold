<p><strong>You have successfully confirmed your request for free updates.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The free sample of The Great Credit Contraction should arrive via email soon or you can download by <a href="http://www.creditcontraction.com/images/The-Great-Credit-Contraction-Sample.pdf" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE EMAILS</strong></p>
<p>I do not take anyone's time or attention for granted.  I realize that you have many places to visit, things to do and places to visit.  Therefore, I want to make sure every email you receive from me is useful, helpful or funny.</p>
<p>You will receive a variety of emails which will be classed into a few main topics such as (1) Updates, (2) Archives, (3) Tips, Products, Humor, and etc.</p>
<p><strong>Updates</strong> will be sent soon after a new article is published.  This email will generally contain a sentence or two that gives a brief synopsis of the new article.  You can click on the link in the email to be taken to the new article.</p>
<p><strong>Archives</strong> will be articles sent on a regular basis, usually every 3-4 days, that were among the most well-received.  These will usually contain information that is either still actionable or provides powerful monetary or economic theory and therefore will be helpful to you in making various financial and economic decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong> will be articles about various tips which I think you will find helpful.  These will range from a variety of topics but are generally useful tidbits of information that will help simplify your life, save you time or money, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Products</strong> will be either my own products such as <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=227184&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=48745" target="_blank">The Great Credit Contraction</a> or reviews of other products that I think would be particularly valuable or useful to you.  You and I most likely hate to be sold but love to buy.  When you find a great product it is only natural to share it with others.  On the other hand, if I find products that are inferior, fraudulent, harmful, etc. then I will include reviews about them in an effort to help protect you from the scoundrels.</p>
<p><strong>Humor</strong> emails will contain various cartoons, jokes, stories, etc. that I have found that are funny.  We all need a break from the seriousness of life and these are bound to bring a chuckle.  Often they do have a very serious economic or financial thread to them though so they would be funny if they were not so sad!</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> of communication will vary depending on the emails that are sent automatically and the updates with new articles.  There is also the deliverability of the email services.  I try to schedule so you receive at most 3-4 emails per week but sometimes there may be more and sometimes less.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong> is very important to me which is why I have another website called <a title="how to vanish" href="http://www.howtovanish.com" target="_blank">How To Vanish</a>.  You have given me permission to send you emails and I respect that.  While I may send you emails about products, etc. I will not sell, reveal, etc. your email address with anyone else unless compelled by law.</p>
<p><strong>Unsubscribe links</strong> are at the bottom of every email.  If you unsubscribe then you will not receive any additional emails from me.  I have plenty of readers and other people who have given me permission to communicate with them to worry about or waste resources chasing those who do not.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Find the emails and make sure you have confirmed the email subscription.  Add the email address to your address book.  This will keep your filtering software from relegating it to the inbox netherworld.</span></strong></p>
<p>Sometimes articles have a useful video which will not be available in the email but will be on RunToGold.com.</p>
<p>To best benefit from the free updates of monetary science applied to current events I recommend becoming acquainted with the intellectual foundation I use for my analysis.</p>
<p>Two easy ways are to read through (1) the <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/recommended/" target="_blank">recommended free articles</a> and (2) <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=227184&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=48745" target="_blank">The Great Credit Contraction</a>.  The recommended free articles are links to various articles I have written that I think will help you, the new reader, but there is no particular organization.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=227184&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=48745" target="_blank">The Great Credit Contraction</a> is an 88 page book which clearly, concisely and logically teaches and lays a strong foundation for the reader in monetary science and basic economic law.  It explains the current environment and how to protect, preserve and grow capital.  You will most likely get more out of your reading</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p><strong>READER COMMENTS ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT CONTRACTION</strong></p>
<p>"Yes, clear! Thanks, my whole perception has again shifted.  Finished the book yesterday.  I studied a little economics at school and Uni and hated it.  Your work is brilliant and makes sense." - reader in Australia</p>
<p>Trace,</p>
<p>Just wanted to thank you for writing "The Great Credit Contraction". It was well worth every FRN$ spent!! I have read it over several times now and it has improved my understanding 1000%! Needless to say, once you start reading the book, it is difficult to put it down. Excellent book!!! Best Regards, William</p>
<p>Hi!! thanks for the quick response!! I got the book safely tucked away in a file,and enjoy reading it. I am 69 years young and I was teacher in a college for 10 years and I know it is a challenging job to convey ideas and concepts which to the author are fairly straight forward but to the audience are sometimes difficult to assess. You have done an excellent job in presenting the economic chaos in which we find ourselves in today in a clear concise and orderly manner. there is a lot of material there and I think for me, it will take a lot of repetitive reading before it all will sink in.Thanks again for your speedy assistance..+ + +  Regards Peter</p>
<p>PS Please use this email for positive feedback in your publications if you desire to do so !!</p>
