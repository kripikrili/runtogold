<p>I have now been using <a href="http://www.myearthclassmail.com" target="_blank">Earth Class Mail</a> for about 6 months.  I am extremely satisfied and highly recommend this business and personal necessity for many <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/get-a-ghost-address/">reasons</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best benefit is increased <strong>privacy</strong>.  Then the time savings and convenience.  Next is being able to have a street address in Oregon which assesses <strong><span style="color: #ff130d;">no sales tax</span></strong>.  For example, if you order a laptop you will pay about $300 in sales tax.<br/><br/>  Shipped to Oregon you pay nothing!  Plus the packages are always delivered so no more waiting around for the Fedex or UPS man.  The packages are shipped from <a href="http://www.myearthclassmail.com" target="_blank">Earth Class Mail</a> via Fedex and easily tracked.</p>
<p>There are some minor downsides.  The cost of about $20 per month (which can be re-cooped).  Their website is rather slow and clunky.  I am excited about the possibility of overseas addresses such as Switzerland and wish they were operational now.  The electronic check deposit is fairly expensive ($1.60 per check and an expensive Wells Fargo bank account is needed).</p>
