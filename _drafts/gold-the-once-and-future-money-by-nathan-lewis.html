<p><strong>THE TRAVELER</strong></p>
<p>While a creature of habit occasionally I find myself traversing the globe in search of nothing particular but a change.  As a digital native and nomad I find this wanderlust leads to interesting places.  My musings here are generally clinical economic or financial constructions with the occasional barbed and fiery political arrow but a few months ago I did receive an interesting request from a reader.  While chatting at the Silver Summit last February he invited me to share some of my traveling stories and to 'keep us informed'.  So here it is.</p>
<p>For months my latent travel bug festered until it exploded.  After reviewing my calendar it appears that over the last 75 days I have spent more time in airplane seats than my own bed.  I marvel at the ability to traverse hundreds of thousands of miles over oceans and mountains with such ease but there is still that constant upward human desire to make it easier and more comfortable.</p>
<p>Perhaps most annoying is when the jet turbine begins to spin and howl and I realize that all too familiar low grinding hum that bombards my eardrums for hours on end.  But this time around I had a secret apparatus that miraculously provided a hushed sanctuary within the crowded cabin:  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bose3headphones" target="_blank">the Bose QuietComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ATTENTION COMPETITION</strong></p>
<p>In the Information Age purveyors of information find themselves steeped in stiff competition and that their information carries two primary costs:  (1) time and (2) money.  The quality of one's content must be exceptional merely to compete for someone's attention and to get someone to pay money is even more difficult.</p>
<p>Usually when I fly I find my concentration interrupted by the crowded cabin and whirring engines.  But with my new ears, trusty iPhone and a few books I could gorge my mind and satiate my voracious information appetite as I found myself able to focus longer and consume more knowledge.  But where would I direct this mental prowess?</p>
<p>The familiar announcement blared over the loudspeaker decreeing that I must turn off my iPhone.  As I scanned around for brain food I saw one of the major newspapers.  It caught my attention only for a couple seconds as I wanted to dirty neither my hands nor my mind.</p>
<p>With the New York Times raising the cost of their Sunday paper 20% from $5 to $6 is it any wonder that <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/03/newspapers-evaporating-at-tremendous-speeds/" target="_blank">newspapers are evaporating with increasing speed</a>?  After all, they are an obsolete relic of a bygone age.  The New York Times should be lowering the price or even giving away the paper for free but instead their influence and circulation will continue dissipating in this increasingly competitive environment.</p>
<p><strong>GOLD: THE ONCE AND FUTURE MONEY</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470047666?tag=run07-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0470047666&amp;adid=11J2YZX51E109D9M8C59&amp;" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" title="Gold the Once and future money by nathan lewis" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Gold-The-Once-And-Future-Money.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="277" /></a>Rather unpredictably I settled on an old-fashioned physical book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470047666?tag=run07-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0470047666&amp;adid=11J2YZX51E109D9M8C59&amp;" target="_blank">Gold: The Once And Future Money</a> by Nathan Lewis.  As I chewed through the chapters I found an abundance of sound economic and monetary theory.  Page after page and chapter after chapter is filled with monetary history from around the world.  The topics are complicated and the writing is dense but this book would serve well as an upper-level undergraduate textbook on monetary theory.</p>
<p>As is typical, not until page 116 does Mr. Lewis hit on <em>the</em> key issue:  "The decision to use gold as the monetary Polaris, the universal standard of value, is not the product of a deductive process, a weighing of pros and cons, but the end result of millennia of trial-and-error experimentation."</p>
<p>Throughout the book logic is present.  But the issue statements and reasoning leaves plenty of room for improved organization and tightened tautological style.  This loquaciousness leaves the issue statements improperly squared resulting in the arguments being porous and subject to semantic and not substantive attack.  Additionally, the use and definition of words could be improved or at least distinguished and synthesized.  But I doubt Mr. Lewis is to fault as this is an endemic linguistic disease in the academic economic literature.</p>
<p>But then the plane landed, I packed up the half-finished book and scurried about my business.  While staying at the magnificent <a href="http://www.hotellabluette.com/" target="_blank">Hotel La Bluette</a> with superb service in Punta del Este the sun was shining and the white capped waves crashed on the beach and beckoned for my attention.  But then a fierce storm rolled in and I found myself perched before a glowing fire with a cup of hot chocolate.  I broke out the book to feed my mind.</p>
<p>After all, the title caught my interest and it was the implied promise to discuss the future of gold that initially lured my attention.  But the search for some paradigm shifting idea or proposal was vain.  I found his persuasive suggestion and view of the future for money and currency, a return to a convertible gold standard with a trading band, to be sorely lacking.  The complete omission from the discussion of <em>private</em> digital commodity currencies, like <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/goldmoney" target="_blank">GoldMoney</a> and others which have been around for over a <em>decade</em>, seems almost like professional negligence.  While still in their infancy these are the greatest advancements in money and currency in all of recorded history.  Any competent monetary scientist <em>should</em> know of these innovations and be able to quickly discern their importance and future role.  Consequently, Mr. Lewis seems too focused on the rearview mirror of the past to perceive through the windshield and elucidate the future for his readers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470047666?tag=run07-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0470047666&amp;adid=11J2YZX51E109D9M8C59&amp;" target="_blank">Gold: The Once And Future Money</a> contains sound economic and monetary theory.  Mr. Lewis plays the historian very well but not the prognosticator.  Within the scopes of either an introductory book to monetary theory or a forward looking view on the future of money and currency I do not recommend it.  For the person who already has some understanding of monetary theory and history and within that scope I recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470047666?tag=run07-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0470047666&amp;adid=11J2YZX51E109D9M8C59&amp;" target="_blank">purchasing and reading Gold: The Once And Future Money</a>.</p>
