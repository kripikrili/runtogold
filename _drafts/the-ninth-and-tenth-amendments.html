<p>The financial crisis is causing some trembling in the political landscape.  34 states are predicting budget gaps totaling $84.3 billion for fiscal 2010.  Time for a Constitutional Law lesson.</p>
<p><strong>THE NINTH AMENDMENT</strong></p>
<p>The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.</p>
<p><strong>THE TENTH AMENDMENT</strong></p>
<p>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.</p>
<p><strong>STATES REASSERTING THEIR SOVEREIGNITY</strong></p>
<p>While some of these resolutions by <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/legtext/49leg/1r/bills/hcr2024p.htm" target="_blank">Arizona</a>, <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/content.aspx?info=/bills091/bills/HR212.HTM" target="_blank">Missouri</a>, <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2009/HCR0006.html" target="_blank">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=149495;article=119309;" target="_blank">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/House%20Joint%20Memorials/4009-State%20sovereignty.pdf" target="_blank">Washington</a> asserting sovereignity under the Tenth Amendment may be cosmetic, non-binding and decreed to please local constituents I would not discount them.  The local state representatives are starting to think.  Real contagion can spread with this in your local state.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2008/10/causing-political-pain/" target="_blank">Political pain</a> can be inflicted and it is fun!  To inflict political pain the politician needs to know that you are a voter in his election.  This means you include your address, etc. in a letter, email or at the local meetings.  The more people you can append with proof of being a voter he needs to win the more political pain you cause.  Political pain is the name of the game for change.</p>
<p>As I discussed earlier Indiana has filed a <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2009/01/sound-money-bill-filed-in-indiana/" target="_blank">Sound Money Bill</a> and New Hampshire did years ago.  Tell your neighbors about the 10th Amendment.  There is no enumerated power in the Constitution to either bailout bankers or steal retirements.</p>
<p>Help educate them about how re-instituting a Constitutional monetary system would cure the <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2008/12/dangerous-virus-rapidly-spreading-globe.html" target="_blank">Financial Insanity Virus</a> epidemic.  We want to help them keep their heads and not panic during these difficult financial times.  In <a href="http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa44.htm" target="_blank">The Federalist No. 44</a> James Madison wrote:</p>
<p><!--StartFragment--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">"No one of these <strong>mischiefs is less incident to a power</strong> in the States to emit paper money, than to coin gold or silver.<span>  </span>The power to make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts, is withdrawn from the States, on the same principle with that of issuing a paper currency.</p>
<p><span>Bills of attainder, ex-post-facto laws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts, are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation.<span>  </span>The two former are <strong>expressly prohibited</strong> by the declarations prefixed to some of the State constitutions, and all of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these fundamental charters.<span>  </span>Our own experience ahs taught us, nevertheless, that additional fences against these dangers ought not to be omitted.<span>  </span><strong>Very properly, therefore, have the convention added this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights</strong>."</span></p>
<p><span><strong>ACTION TO TAKE</strong></span></p>
<p><span>There is no enumerated power for either the Federal or State governments to make an illusion like the FRN$ either legal tender or to charge a 28% collectibles tax on capital gains from bullion sales.  <strong>Start causing some political pain by demanding from your local representatives the removal of any sales or collectible taxes on bullion.</strong><br />
