<p>This review was originally written months ago but I think was lost due to the various site upgrades so I hope all the new readers find it helpful.  On Thursday 14 August 2008 I boarded the Greyhound:  Destination Los Angeles.  I hate Los Angeles traffic and the Amtrak schedule did not meet my schedule needs so I took the bus and arrived in a rather shady part of town but was quickly whisked away to a quaint cafe in Santa Monica.</p>
<p><span>Michael Maloney and the rest of our party enjoyed a delicious lunch which Michael characteristically paid for.  My burger with brei was fantastic.  Over lunch we all got a new copy of Mike’s book which he even signed.  Then we headed over to Mike’s house for the real purpose of our trip which involved some important business.</span></p>
<p><span>As an author I know firsthand the satisfaction that comes from knowing one’s work is consumed and the even rarer event that it changes the reader’s perspective.  Despite our personal acquaintance this review is completely unsolicited.  In fact, when I accepted the book I did not even say I would read it.  I get so many books and although I am a voracious reader I have so little time to consume them all.</span></p>
<p><span>So, there I was, on the Greyhound for a few hours returning from an arduous day of business discussions.  I decided to read at least a couple pages.</span></p>
<p><span>I was surprised from the start.  Mike’s imagery in describing gold and silver’s undefeated record of either <strong>technical</strong> or <strong>knock-out wins</strong> against fiat currency is very illustrative.  Given the events that have transpired since I originally wrote this review and as the FRN$ has continued collapsing the book's prescience is every more starkly important.</span></p>
<p><span>Some ideas could have been further developed but I am sure that would have taken many more than the 202 pages in the book.  Mike said the original manuscript was over 800 pages!</span></p>
<p><span>For example, Mike does not delve too deeply into the <strong>why</strong>, other than the simple supply and demand reasons, of the revaluations.  In case any care, national currencies are the ‘common stock’ of nations.  Gold and silver balance the balance sheets of nations.</span></p>
<p><span>As the pages progressed I noticed the monetary science and theory got progressively more complex but was still presented in such a way as to quickly educate the reader.  Such skill in an author is rarely found.  This book could serve as a college level textbook for Monetary Science and Theory 101 and 102.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps someday such courses will be taught but probably not as long as federal funds are used.  For now <strong>if someone wants to learn the truth about money they must learn it on their own.</strong> This book helps in that education.</span></p>
<p><span>I finished it fairly quickly and consider it an easy read.  The complex concepts and principles are broken down in easy to understand writing.  The logic flows in a well organized way.  While serious it has some humorous parts. I will probably add the terms ‘bunny money’ and ‘financial voodoo’ to my lexicon.  Therefore, for <em>anyone</em> interested in the precious metals I recommend reading Mike's <a title="guide to investing in gold and silver" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRich-Dads-Advisors-Investing-Everything%2Fdp%2F0446510998%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1219090869%26sr%3D8-1&amp;tag=run07-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank">Guide to Investing in Gold and Silver</a>.</span></p>
