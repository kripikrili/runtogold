<p>You have unlimited options for information on the Internet.  I am glad you find RunToGold worthy of your time and attention.  RunToGold started as a hobby, has had tremendous growth and in less than a year it is routinely receiving more unique visitors in a day than it used to receive in a month.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="RunToGold Traffic Growth" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/RunToGold-Traffic-July-5-2009.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="220" /></p>
<p>If you are a returning reader then you derive value from the content you consume from RunToGold. You may have implemented suggestions that have saved you money, time, some type of hassle or earned you lucrative profits.</p>
<p>The creation of this content is the result of very skilled and technical work by someone who takes pride in their product. Additionally, there are cash expenses to keep the website hosted and fast, the email list operational, pictures, videos, etc.</p>
<p>I enjoy some pretty expensive hobbies such as golf, sailing and travel.  But I avoid debt like I would avoid the plague and live within my means.  I derive utility from RunToGold and my efforts are not driven solely by a profit motive as I have plenty of more lucrative avenues.</p>
<p>But like my other expensive hobbies I will not allow this one to become a black hole on my financial statement with its exponential growth.  I already know the stuff I write about and I am glad you also derive value and utility from my efforts and therefore I ask for your support.</p>
<p>I realize that you can either pay with <strong>time</strong> or <strong>money</strong>.  I hate advertisements and want to keep their use to a minimum because the time of most readers is so valuable.  For example, if I have some blinking ad that distracts and annoys you for 4 seconds and you read 10 articles per month then that amounts to 40 seconds of time and disrupted attention.  If you earn $300/hour then that amounts to $0.083/second and therefore 40 seconds of time is approximately $3.33.</p>
<p><strong>PASSING THE PLATE</strong></p>
<p>I challenge every regular reader to donate a mere <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10 cents per day</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> to support the site</span></strong>.  This amounts to about $3/month or $36.50/year. <strong>Honestly, do</strong><strong> you get more value from RunToGold or a caffe latte grande?</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter" title="Donation Plate" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/donation-plate.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="282" /></strong></p>
<p>Of course, because this appeal for donations is purely voluntary if you feel you do not derive value from RunToGold then you can always pass.  The hope is that a cadre of loyal readers who take financial journalism seriously will support the efforts put into creating high quality content.  A stable and predictable cashflow will allow for better management of content creation such as the various website upgrades that have happened, podcasts, videos, research, etc.</p>
<p>Statistically the average sponsorship rate for websites is a mere 0.5% of readers.  However, those who frequent RunToGold are better educated, fairly affluent and more intelligent than the average demographic.  They also tend to have a better grasp of economic laws like unsustainable enterprises ceasing to exist.  Therefore, I hope the sponsorship rate will be at least 5%.  Another excellent way to show your support is by purchasing a copy of <a title="the great credit contraction" href="http://www.creditcontraction.com" target="_blank">The Great Credit Contraction</a>.</p>
<p>I appreciate your support to keep this site up and running!  Your donations are gratefully accepted via PayPal, cash, checks, money orders, "Forever" Liberty Bell postage stamps or any other form of gift.</p>

<p>Note:  If you send a cash donation then please either <strong>round down </strong>to $36 or <strong>round up</strong> to $37.  If you include two quarters then because of having an overweight 'non-machine sortable' envelope the the postal service will charge an extra 72 cents.  If you send cash then please wrap it in paper so the honest postal workers or anyone else cannot identify it.  Thanks!</p>
